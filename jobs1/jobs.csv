Most technology in education is not built for the modern learning experience. It’s complex, unpredictable and no two classes are ever the same. Teachers waste time on non-teaching activities and they find it difficult to collaborate with other teachers. At Firefly, we’re freeing teachers to have a greater impact on the learning experience. Firefly allows teachers to innovate and cater to each student’s needs, preparing all students for success in the future.

**How you can help**

We already have a rich legacy, we’ve won loads of awards and have earned a reputation as the easiest to use school learning tool. But we have even greater ambitions to help every student reach their full potential. We’re at a pivotal point in what we do, with big plans for our product and exciting opportunities ahead of us. We want to work with an expert in user research so that we all understand the challenges in modern education better. With your guidance, we’ll be able to make the best decisions for our product based on what matters most to schools.

- Is empathetic towards the needs of all the different stakeholders on a project. This means being flexible and striking a balance between meticulous insights gathering, and enabling the team to take action.

*In return, you will benefit from:*

- Being able to establish the practice of User Researcher within the organisation

- Being part of a growing and thriving Product/Design organisation

- Being able to have a real impact on the usability of our products and thus aid teaching and learning.

*You have proven experience in the following:*

- This is a senior role so we are looking for someone with at least 4 years experience of hands on user research for products that have shipped.

- You have experience with a range of quantitative and qualitative methodologies such as ethnographic studies, usability testing, remote testing and survey design.

- You have lead product teams through a variety of different generative and evaluative projects.

- You have previously worked in an agile environment with a product, service or UX Design team.

- This role would be perfect for someone looking for their first senior role, especially if you’ve been working as part of a larger research team and ready to take a step up to lead the process yourself.

*Your first couple of months:*

- Lots of introductions with people and teams across the business where you can learn about our purpose, our product strategy, our process and our plans for the future.

- Learning about all the different ways we currently gather knowledge about our users.

- Visiting schools, getting to know what the modern learning experience is like.

- Absorbing the research that has been done so far to familiarise yourself with our users and areas of focus.

- Coaching the team in all the different research methods that they can call on to conduct research and solve problems themselves.

*Over time:*

- Carry out a variety of quantitative and qualitative studies with people from schools, both remote and in-person.

- Engage with third party research agencies to source participants.

- Helping us find a consistent way of storing our knowledge, making sure it is accessible to everyone, and where everyone can contribute.

- Working with the Design Lead and PMs to develop a research roadmap.

- Developing a toolkit of research methods, report templates and a shared vocabulary for our research practices.

**Our team**

You’ll be joining the Design team as the first UX Researcher. We’re a small team, but are respected across the whole company for our expertise and commitment to providing the best experience for our users. We work closely with the Product team, so we continually have the opportunity to guide and shape the direction of the product. We’re really passionate about design, and love to do meaningful work and get things done.

We aim to learn at every opportunity. We receive an annual training budget and use this to attend conferences, workshops, take online courses and have shelves full of books in our workspaces. We like to hang out together too–we go for dinner together regularly and do all sorts of activities with the wider Firefly team.

You can read a bit more about some of our recent design activities in our team blog https://medium.com/firefly-design and see a video of what it’s like to work at Firefly.

*Location, travel and flexibility:*

- We ideally want someone who is either based primarily in London (our office is in Hammersmith) or is happy to spend some of the time there.

- We are open minded about the possibility of someone who wishes to work remotely in the UK some or even most of the time. Tell us on your application and we can talk about it with you if you are short-listed.

- Some travel will be required to meet customers and attend research sessions but much of the work we do can be done remotely in the UK.

- We understand the need for flexibility due to the nature of this job so we are happy to discuss flexible working arrangements.

You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You think strategically**

You are a big–picture thinker but understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues and workshops are often your medium of choice. Your primary outputs are invariably physical rather than digital - such as walls full of post-it notes.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your findings and ideas with colleagues, peers and the community, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as JTBD or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

### Does this sound like you?

If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

We’re a group of smart, passionate people with the support, trust and freedom to do the job we love. We’re free from the typical constraints of big agencies and have fostered a culture that encourages you to do the best and most fulfilling work of your career. There are a number of key attitudes shared by everyone at Clearleft:

**You get under the skin of problems**

You insist on a deeper understanding of the problem before rushing into solutions, even if that sometimes means starting out with ‘just enough research’. You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You’re a visual thinker**

You understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. Workshops are often your medium of choice. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues, but you’re also hands-on enough to help bring those ideas into reality.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your ideas with colleagues and peers, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as Lean or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

# Does this sound like you?
If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

**Some things worth noting**

- Applicants should be eligible to work in the UK
- We are keeping this vacancy open until it is filled, which means there is no closing date for applications
- We endeavour to get in touch with candidates within four weeks of you contacting us, which typically begins with a casual chat prior to a more formal interview process

We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly. We’re expanding our team to make our brand (even more) famous, bringing the benefits of smarter and fairer car insurance to more motorists.

We’re looking for a talented UX/UI designer with a strong portfolio that’s interested in helping continue to build and improve a market-leading car insurance app and web platform, as well as helping shape the future of a young brand.

As car insurance is a legal requirement in the UK, it’s a product that appeals to many different types of people. Our members are from all over the country, aged from 23 through to 78, and we know we can only keep doing our best work with a diverse team that reflects that.

Working for a startup, you’ll be involved in all areas of a product lifecycle, from the initial discovery phase to supporting developers as they get your work into production. You’ll be helping with everything from building on the foundations of the brand and evolving our character, iterating on the existing UX/UI of our app, web platform, website and quote journey as well as our internal admin panel. You’ll also be creating, leading and documenting improvements to our style, UI library and design process.

In your portfolio it would be great to see examples of work all the way through the process - from wireframing through to final design. Please also share any examples of your experience in the discovery, planning and testing process.



**You will be:**

- Working closely with our Head of Brand & Product and Product Manager, leading the design of all of our external and internal products.
- The voice of digital product design within the business, interpreting objectives and goals from across the business and transforming them into fully designed end-to-end flows and concepts.
- Responsible for building on, moulding and evolving our UI guidelines and processes, continuing to build out our libraries, templates and toolkits to ensure our style is always consistent.
- Collaborating with product managers and developers within an agile/scrum sprint framework to iterate on new features and UX/UI improvements to our app, web platform, emails, website and quote site.
- Helping create and establish an efficient and scalable design system.
- Working closely with our marketing and content team to deliver features, in-app or onsite campaigns and digital design concepts to support nationwide marketing and press campaigns.
- Collaborating with freelance designers or outside agencies, where appropriate, to produce work to the same high standard as you do.
- Visualising data, infographics and illustrations for reports, pitch decks, emails and blogs.


This role will primarily be based in our London office (so wouldn't be suitable for someone looking to work remotely full time), but we're always open to remote or more flexible working arrangements if travel, childcare or something else gets in the way. This is subject to our flexible working policy, and we can discuss this in more detail if you come for interview.



**We’d like to meet someone with:**

- Experience in UX/UI design, who can share work they’ve done across apps, responsive webpages and purchase flows.
- A good attention to detail and an eye for consistency across multiple touchpoints.
- A high standard of icon and vector illustration (demonstrated by a strong portfolio) and basic experience of animation/motion graphic experience.
- The desire to work together with different teams across our business to solve problems and bounce around ideas that can improve life for our members and make our service better.
- Experience using the full Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Adobe After Effects primarily) and Sketch (for digital designs), alongside use of hand-over and prototyping tools. Experience with any other platforms will be a bonus.
- The confidence to prep, plan and run discovery workshops, planning sessions and usability workshops.


**Bonus points if you:**

- Have experience working at or with an early stage startup.
- Have a basic flair for copywriting.
- Have had any exposure (however limited) to coding, HTML or front-end development - whether that’s in website design, email building or creating banner ads.


**What are the benefits?**

- Enrolment into the By Miles pension plan after passing your three month probation.
- Local gym membership discount.
- Remote and flexible working opportunities (subject to our remote and flexible working policy).
- Personal training budget (to support professional development and certification).
- Personal book budget (so you can add to our ever-growing library).
- Access to monthly sessions with our independent coach to help with personal & professional development and wellness at work.
- Regular social events.
- Join a fast-growing and exciting startup with excellent growth opportunities.
- Work with a fun and highly-motivated team where there's never a dull moment.
- West London office (Hammersmith) with great transport links (District, Circle, Hammersmith & City and Piccadilly Lines).

At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

## About You

As a UI/UX Designer, you will help to deliver world class customer experiences for our clients, guiding them on best practice in visual design, user experience and design development, as well as delivering design outputs of your own.

* This is a client facing delivery role with a mix of advising, implementing and delivering, sometimes across multiple clients

* Ability to flex between UX and UI if required a plus

## Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:

* We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
* There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
* Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

Professional development. Accelerated career progression. An environment that encourages entrepreneurial spirit. It’s all on offer at Capgemini.

## Why we’re different
At Capgemini, we help organisations across the world become more agile, more competitive and more successful. Smart, tailored, often-groundbreaking technical solutions to complex problems are the norm. But so, too, is a culture that’s as collaborative as it is forward thinking. Working closely with each other, and with our clients, we get under the skin of businesses and to the heart of their goals. You will too.
Capgemini is proud to represent nearly 130 nationalities and its cultural diversity. Our holistic definition of diversity extends beyond gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, race, age and religion. Capgemini views diversity as everything that makes us who we are as an organization, including our social background, our experiences in life and work, our communication styles and even our personality.  These dimensions contribute to the type of diversity we value the most: diversity of thought.
We want to make sure that we find the right people to work in our teams, and we know that working full-time isn’t necessarily right for everyone. So we’d love to hear from you if you feel you’re a great fit for this role, and would like to work flexibly. As an example, some of our team members work four days a week, but travel across the UK during their working days. Or you might prefer to work three days a week (in a job share scenario) with travel limited to Greater London. If you are the right person for this role, we’ll find the right working approach for you.
