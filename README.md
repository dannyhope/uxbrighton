# UX Brighton

All comprehensive instructions, for how to run and edit the website, have moved to the Ops Manual - https://uxbri.org/ops.

Once you've installed all the necessary Ruby & Jekyll global dependencies, you can run the site locally as follows...

---

## Initial setup

```bash
# Install all Node dev dependencies
npm install

# Kick off initial local build
npm start
```

## Local development

```bash
# Spin up a local server
npm run dev

# Need to spin up the Netlify CMS GUI?
npm run cms-local
```

## Local build

```bash
# Build all files & assets to the `_site` directory
npm run build
```
