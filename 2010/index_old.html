			<h3>What we're trying to do</h3>

			<p><span class="event-name">UX Brighton 2010</span> is an extension of one of our successful monthly meetings. It is the conference for the design and web technology community. Due to the success of the monthly meetups, we decided to turn the September meetup into a full blown one day event. </p>

			<p>This one day event gives wide exposure to some of the most recent captivating and provocative ideas on User Experience from all over the UK and Europe. The speakers combine the well-known, such as Rory Sutherland and Eric Reiss, with others who are yet to be discovered.  It is an opportunity for the User Experience community to hear about and discuss design and behaviour in both theory and practise.</p>

			<h3>About the organisers</h3>

		    <h4 style="margin-left:1em">UX Brighton</h4>
            <p>UX Brighton is a volunteer community group aiming to disseminate knowledge in all aspects of user experience (including various branches of psychology). It was started 2 years ago by Danny Hope. UX Brighton has been running monthly meetups that have gone from a few people in a room, to occasionally over 150 people attending.</p>

			<h4 style="margin-left:1em">Danny Hope</h4>

			<p>Danny is a highly experienced freelance User Experience Consultant and founder of <a href="https://uxbri.org/">UX Brighton</a>. He's been developing hypermedia since before the web and professionally since 1997. He's currently based in the south of England and specialises in interaction design for web applications. You can follow him on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/yandle">@yandle</a>.</p>

			<h4 style="margin-left:1em">James Page</h4>

			<p>James is co-founder of <a href="http://www.feralabs.com/">FeraLabs</a>, a usability consultancy specialising in remote user research. He is also involved in the development of <a href="http://www.webnographer.com/">Webnographer</a>, an online tool for remote usability testing.</p>

			<p>James started off as a programmer, but soon realised that, to see what he has created becoming a reality, he would have to be entrepreneur as well. James has been involved in a number of start ups, including Eidos (who went on to launch Tomb Raider), and Deckchair.com with Bob Geldof. He is passionate about making software less frustrating.
