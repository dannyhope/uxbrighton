# UX Brighton 2017 Sponsorship

## [UX Brighton 2017](http://uxbrighton.org.uk)

## UX Brighton, 3rd November. A one-day conference for UX people

## About UX Brighton

Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks around a single theme.

This year’s theme is **Designing for Complexity**.

Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.

## A boutique team

UX Brighton is carefully curated by Danny Hope, a [UX consultant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyhope) with over a decade of experience. In all matters logistical, practical and eventful [Emmeline Caines-Gooby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmeline-caines-gooby-9579195) ensures the conference runs like a smoothly oiled machine. Emm's been working with Danny since 2011. Danny and Emm are backed up by a team of volunteers who all work to ensure the conference is a great day for all our attendees, speakers and sponsors.

If you're interested in sponsoring, please either email **[emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk)**
or DM **[@uxbri](https://twitter.com/direct_messages/create/uxbri)** (DMs are open).

## About our 2017 conference

UX Brighton has grown, and we're moving to the Concert Hall in the Brighton Dome; a larger, more comfortable space to accommodate the expansion. We're expecting 400+ super-savvy delegates (designers, developers, product people etc). However, just because we are growing, it doesn't mean we don't need your help - if anything, we need it more than ever!

Our delegates want to hear from companies that support us. They are looking for new jobs, resources and tools. The UX community will share their knowledge so that those who support us will continue to receive the benefit long after. As you might expect, we’re a creative bunch, so encourage our sponsors to think beyond the exhibition stand.

We've got lots of ideas, and welcome your suggestions too. Think:

* **FUN** - Entertainment during the breaks in a day full of cerebral, mind expanding talks can be a great way to engage our delegates. Maybe sponsor a co-branded Photobooth.

* **GREAT GIVEAWAYS** - Quality items such as branded Post-Its, Sharpies, notebooks and re-usable aluminium water bottles. Items that delegates want and use long after the conference.

* **DAYTIME TREATS** - Enhance the experience by sponsoring fruit, pastries and coffee throughout the day.

* **FLASH YOUR LOGO** - Lanyards, volunteer t-shirts etc

* **AFTER PARTY** - Everyone loves the chance to network and discuss the day once the conference wraps, what better way than to sponsor the after party?!

# We'll organise the ordering of branded goods, working with you closely for the best output.
