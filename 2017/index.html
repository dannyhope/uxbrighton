		<section class="aleksandra">
			<h3 class="speaker">Aleksandra Melnikova</h3><img class="portrait" src="">
			<p>Aleks is an Experience Design Director bringing the power of connected disciplines into design, research and team management. Being trained in Arts and Product Service Systems design is a combination that enables her to make any project, no matter the size, her playground by creating new methods, tools and approaches, frequently challenging the existing structures and status quo. Over the last 10 years, she has worked both client and agency side and has led and successfully delivered (digital) experiences for companies like VISA, Lloyds, TSB, SKY, Aviva, VSO, GSK and British Airways. Aleks currently leads the Experience design team at Radley Yeldar, her role being to connect the company from within, driving experience excellence and strategy.</p>
			<p>When not at work, she collaborates with a few UK universities, blogs about the connections between literature, art and design and spends time suspended in the air trying to become a pro at aerial arts.</p>
			<h4>Breaking the (design) confines</h4>
			<p>In the race for profitability, digital agencies rush to establish processes to ensure stable and successful delivery. Those processes can often feel very mechanic, almost like an assembly line. But they often forget something. Good design is not done in established phases. It comes from multiple drivers, from courage and from change, above all. It comes from unexpected associations, from art and philosophy, from metaphors and connections. My talk is based around exploring the connections between design and multiple (seemingly unrelated) disciplines, with a focus on methods and techniques that enable people to create richer design artefacts and experiences (extending beyond digital).</p>
