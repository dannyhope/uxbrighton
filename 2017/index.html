		<h3 class="speaker">Swimming in Complexity
		<br><span>James&nbsp;Box</span></h3>
		<p>New projects feel great.  Everything is possible. You’re working with a new team, full of ambition. This is the one you’ve been waiting for. A chance to use all those new methods, embrace new mindsets and design the killer user experience you know you have in you.
		</p>
		<p>Then something changes. One or two of your stakeholders have developed ‘interesting’ expectations. The development team is struggling to prise resources away from delivery. Your attempts to get everybody aligned, means your research budget has now got worryingly close to zero. Then the project manager hits you with the MVP stick.</p>
		<p>Somewhere, somehow, things got complex. And now you’re feeling overwhelmed and full of fear.</p>
		<p>This is a talk about what to do when you encounter that feeling. James will talk about ways to recognise the symptoms of complexity and how to respond in a way that makes sense for you and your team.</p>

		<h3 class="speaker">Hypothetically Coherent
		<br><span>Liz&nbsp;Keogh</span></h3>
		<p>We know from the Lean UX community that hypotheses can help us to create experiments, finding out what users want with real data - but if the hypothesis fails, is there sometimes more to learn?</p>
		<p>In this talk Liz introduces Cynefin, a framework for making sense of different situations and how to approach them depending on their predictability. We look at the role of complexity in human interaction in generating unexpected but important side-effects, and the difference between hypothesis / experiment and coherence / probe as ways of enabling discovery across multiple human dimensions.</p>
		<p>Louis Pasteur said that in the field of observation, chance favours the prepared mind. Come and find out how to prepare yours!</p>

		<h3 class="speaker">Measuring customer effort with top tasks
			<br><span>Gerry&nbsp;McGovern</span></h3>
		<p>A customer centric universe involves reducing time and effort for people as they seek to complete their top tasks. Top Tasks Management gives you a model to prove that you are optimising the experience of your customers. It’s all about focusing on the activity of the customer, rather than what has traditionally happened — focusing on the activity of the organisation.

		<h3 class="speaker">Applying systems thinking in product design
			<br><span>ShekMan Tang</span></h3>

		<p>To design a great product, you need to understand its foundations before focusing on the details. That’s where systems thinking comes in. It’s a top-down approach where you consider the big picture first and the specific interactions later.	</p>
		<p>It helps you establish a design system early, which sets the course of the product direction, gets the team on the same page, and focuses your design effort on the most important product areas.</p>
		<p>In this talk ShekMan Tang will introduce the foundations of systems thinking, and how we could apply it in the practice of product design.</p>

	<h3 class="speaker">Breaking the (design) confines
		<br><span>Aleksandra&nbsp;Melnikova</span></h3>
	<p>In the race for profitability, digital agencies rush to establish processes to ensure stable and successful delivery. Those processes can often feel very mechanic, almost like an assembly line. But they often forget something. Good design is not done in established phases. It comes from multiple drivers, from courage and from change, above all. It comes from unexpected associations, from art and philosophy, from metaphors and connections. My talk is based around exploring the connections between design and multiple (seemingly unrelated) disciplines, with a focus on methods and techniques that enable people to create richer design artefacts and experiences (extending beyond digital).</p>

		<h3 class="speaker">Models from Complexity Science
			<br><span>Karen&nbsp;Cham</span></h3>
		<p>In popular dialogues, describing a system as “complex” is often the point of resignation, inferring that the system cannot be sufficiently described, predicted nor managed. Scientific dialogues however, have explored the collective behaviours of complexity to formally define a complex system. This presentation will introduce generic principles from complex systems science, and unpack how and why they can be applied to user experience design.</p>

		<h3 class="speaker">Differentiating with Design Activism
			<br><span>Daniel&nbsp;Harris</span></h3>
		<p>We’re in an incredible era of un-precidented technological opportunity where anything we can imagine can be built. As designers, we’re at the forefront of making this technology work for organisations. The question is, are we pointing this power in a positive direction?
		</p>

		<p>Welcome, generation i!. You are more likely to be depressed and mentally unwell than ever before! Our digital culture compounds these generational challenges and the industry continues to treat digital like an exploitable asset. So what happens then as that asset becomes further and further a part of society. A part of our humanity?
		</p>

		<p>At the same time this generation is valuing the part organisations have to play in improving communities and lives – not just with sponsorship or CSR programmes, but in the way they operate and serve. And it’s becoming part of big business. Some estimates suggest that 75% of the S&P 500 companies will not exist in 2027 – companies unable to respond to the rate of change in customer expectations of them.

		</p>

		<p>In comes Design Activism; termed by Alistair Fuad-Luke as “design thinking, imagination and practice applied… to generate and balance positive social, institutional, environmental and/or economic change.”
		</p>

		<p>I’ll use stories and examples to show how UXers are increasingly empowered to build the world they want to see, with their client and organisational stakeholders with them all the way. In this new era, appetite, point of view, and passion become major ingredients for unleashing the power of UX and design into a new realm of influence.
