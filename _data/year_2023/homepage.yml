        Creativity is broad, innovation has been overused so let’s define our
        terms:


        **creativity** *n*. coming up with new ways to think about things


        **innovation** *n*. creating ways to solve problems


        As user experience designers, it's essential to empathize with users and employ various methods to address their needs effectively. However, achieving our best work requires us to turn the lens inward and apply user-centered design principles to our ways of working and our relationships. By doing so, we can better serve those whose problems we aim to solve.


        Amid tight deadlines, finding the time and space for self-reflection and growth can be challenging. UX Brighton 2023 offers a rare opportunity for attendees to focus on themselves in a dedicated environment, fostering creativity and innovation.


        When creativity is provided with room to grow, it paves the way for innovation. Embracing innovation offers your organization a valuable edge. Each individual has the capacity for increased creativity. Discover techniques to enhance your creative abilities at UX Brighton 2023.


        Join us in this enriching journey as we explore the power of creativity and innovation together, and take the user experience design field to new heights. Register now and secure your place in this transformative event!

          talk-title: What is Creativity?
          talk-summary: >-
            In the realm of design, creativity remains an elusive and often
            misunderstood concept. How do we define creativity, and what makes
            it so integral to the world of design and beyond? Drawing from her
            background in philosophy, psychology, and the intersection of art
            and AI, Alice Helliwell delves into the concept of creativity,
            exploring its various facets and its essential role in human
            thinking and making.


            In this stimulating talk, Alice will unravel the philosophical underpinnings of creativity, exploring definitions that go beyond artistic endeavors. Through an analytical lens, she will navigate the audience through intriguing questions surrounding creativity, such as its value, its relationship with innovation and its potential to inspire change.


            Alice's talk promises to be a thought-provoking exploration of what creativity truly means and how it can be harnessed to enhance our understanding and practice of design.

            University. Alice's research is focussed on computational creativity
            and AI art. Her work examines questions such as 'can AI be
            creative?', 'can AI make art, and if so, can it make *good* art?'
            and 'are there any unique aesthetic qualities of AI images?'. Alice
            is also currently involved in projects examining how ethics
            education can be integrated into computer science curricula, and
            exploring the relevance of Wittgesteinian philosophy for AI.

          talk-summary: >-
            I’ve spent my career in data visualisation working in ways that are
            considered ‘wrong’ or not in line with ‘best’ practices. But by
            adhering to best practices, could we be missing out on the \*best\*
            parts of our fields through these inherent limitations? What
            creative approaches can you discover when you explicitly set out to
            do the opposite of what you are ‘supposed’ to do?


            Using examples from my creative practice, this talk is a celebration of what there is to gain when we are wilfully, perversely, and joyously ‘wrong’ in how we as designers work with our fields’ respective design processes.

          talk-summary: For most of its 200-year history, the Guardian existed only in
            print but today millions of people across the world choose the
            digital experience of our journalism. As behaviours change and
            technology advances, the role that Product Design plays is more
            important than ever. Tricky will talk about his leadership of the
            Product Design team and how it differs from his previous work,
            leading teams within creative agencies. He will provide a rare,
            behind-the-scenes look at his team’s approach and bring this to life

          talk-title: Unleash your inner innovator
          talk-summary: >-
            Design is about creating change. As designers, we offer the most
            value when we’re shaping problems to tackle and not just shipping
            features. However, in many organisations, it is easy for designers
            to get boxed into a pure delivery role merely adding polish at the
            end of the process. 


            Innovation is a mindset and a set of skills that with a little effort can be developed. So stop waiting to be struck by that eureka moment. Stop waiting to be asked to head up an innovation project. Instead, take the initiative and introduce design-led innovation techniques to your workplace and your work practice.


            In this talk, Chris will share some practical strategies for designers to develop their inner innovator. With a focus on looking at what’s in your gift to change, starting small but thinking big, and embracing constraints. He’ll help you to kickstart a move in your organisation to use design to identify, investigate and incubate innovative ideas.

            Large organisations were never designed for successful service
            delivery. Rooted in age-old structures built around internal
            functions, embracing a service led approach often goes against every
            fibre. 


            This talk is about what we can do to help our organisations deliver services that really work. Forget about creating separate innovation hubs or creative teams, this needs a radical change to how everyone designs, delivers, collaborates and decides. 


            And it starts by seeing things differently: our services, how they perform, and the value in improving them. This talk has practical examples and ideas that you can share and use in your organisations this week.

          talk-title: Sneaking agility back into Agile
          talk-summary: >-
            Agile. It's everywhere. And it's become the dominant orthodoxy under
            which many designers are struggling.\

            \

            Why is that? Why do Agile and design often seem to mix like tuna and custard? And why does a methodology that's supposed to speed up innovation actually slow it down?\

            \

            Directly attacking Agile doesn't help. Tom will share some ways he's made this very mistake. But there is hope! He'll also share some tried and tested Trojan Horses that you can use right away to sneak agility back into Agile, opening the gates to innovation and creativity.

          bio-summary: >-
            Tom has 25 years of experience as a leader in design, research and
            product. He's co-founded two successful startups and worked both
            agency-side and in-house, coaching cross-functional teams to
            innovate.\

            \

            Since running his first usability test in 1999, Tom has been obsessed with adaptive sense-making: how do we continuously make sense of the world so we can act more effectively in it?\

            \

            He is the author of Innovation Tactics, the deck of cards from Pip Decks that's packed with pragmatic methods for making things people want. He's also the creator of Pivot Triggers, a simple but powerful idea that's helped hundreds of teams become more adaptive by doing discovery and delivery at the same time.

          talk-title: The critical importance of supporting designer and developer
            creativity
          talk-summary: When we think about UX as a discipline, what often first comes to
            mind are everyday consumer experiences from websites to games, or
            perhaps enterprise and productivity tools. In recent years however,
            Elizabeth has focused instead on UX for *designers and
            developers* and how to enhance and support their creativity. Based
            in studies of designer and developer experiences, Elizabeth’s team
            have been improving documentation, working on task accomplishment
            and smoothing workflows, focusing on better communication and
            collaboration, and addressing tech and design debt management and
            team productivity.In this talk, Elizabeth will discuss case studies,
            and share why supporting designer and developer creative tools leads
            to better and more inclusive user experiences for everyone.
