          talk-title: The critical importance of supporting designer and developer
            creativity
          talk-summary: When we think about UX as a discipline, what often first comes to
            mind are everyday consumer experiences from websites to games, or
            perhaps enterprise and productivity tools. In recent years however,
            Elizabeth has focused instead on UX for *designers and
            developers* and how to enhance and support their creativity. Based
            in studies of designer and developer experiences, Elizabeth’s team
            have been improving documentation, working on task accomplishment
            and smoothing workflows, focusing on better communication and
            collaboration, and addressing tech and design debt management and
            team productivity.In this talk, Elizabeth will discuss case studies,
            and share why supporting designer and developer creative tools leads
            to better and more inclusive user experiences for everyone.
