        Creativity is broad, innovation has been overused so let’s define our
        terms:


        **creativity** *n*. coming up with new ways to think about things


        **innovation** *n*. creating ways to solve problems


        As user experience designers, it's essential to empathize with users and employ various methods to address their needs effectively. However, achieving our best work requires us to turn the lens inward and apply user-centered design principles to our ways of working and our relationships. By doing so, we can better serve those whose problems we aim to solve.


        Amid tight deadlines, finding the time and space for self-reflection and growth can be challenging. UX Brighton 2023 offers a rare opportunity for attendees to focus on themselves in a dedicated environment, fostering creativity and innovation.


        When creativity is provided with room to grow, it paves the way for innovation. Embracing innovation offers your organization a valuable edge. Each individual has the capacity for increased creativity. Discover techniques to enhance your creative abilities at UX Brighton 2023.


        Join us in this enriching journey as we explore the power of creativity and innovation together, and take the user experience design field to new heights. Register now and secure your place in this transformative event!

          talk-title: The critical importance of supporting designer and developer
            creativity
          talk-summary: When we think about UX as a discipline, what often first comes to
            mind are everyday consumer experiences from websites to games, or
            perhaps enterprise and productivity tools. In recent years however,
            Elizabeth has focused instead on UX for *designers and
            developers* and how to enhance and support their creativity. Based
            in studies of designer and developer experiences, Elizabeth’s team
            have been improving documentation, working on task accomplishment
            and smoothing workflows, focusing on better communication and
            collaboration, and addressing tech and design debt management and
            team productivity.In this talk, Elizabeth will discuss case studies,
            and share why supporting designer and developer creative tools leads
            to better and more inclusive user experiences for everyone.

          talk-summary: >-
            Mark's talk will explore how to foster innovation and creativity in
            the workplace.


            He will discuss the concept of Kaizen (Lean, Agile, Design Thinking) and how its ideas can be utilized to ensure everyone in the company is constantly innovating how they work.  He will provide an innovation and cultural framework which can be integrated into your company's culture with psychological safety in mind. He will outline specific ideas on enabling creativity and allowing creativity in everyone to flourish. This means everyone will be able to be innovative and creative, which could lead to unintended consequences. Perhaps even using the newly possible to learn and create groundbreaking products and services to help the common good.


            But the primary outcome will be improved speed, quality, and overall effectiveness in your day-to-day work.

          talk-summary: For most of its 200-year history, the Guardian existed only in
            print but today millions of people across the world choose the
            digital experience of our journalism. As behaviours change and
            technology advances, the role that Product Design plays is more

            behind-the-scenes look at his team’s approach and bring this to life

          talk-title: Unleash your inner innovator
          talk-summary: >-
            Design is about creating change. As designers, we offer the most
            value when we’re shaping problems to tackle and not just shipping
            features. However, in many organisations, it is easy for designers
            to get boxed into a pure delivery role merely adding polish at the
            end of the process. 


            Innovation is a mindset and a set of skills that with a little effort can be developed. So stop waiting to be struck by that eureka moment. Stop waiting to be asked to head up an innovation project. Instead, take the initiative and introduce design-led innovation techniques to your workplace and your work practice.


            In this talk, Chris will share some practical strategies for designers to develop their inner innovator. With a focus on looking at what’s in your gift to change, starting small but thinking big, and embracing constraints. He’ll help you to kickstart a move in your organisation to use design to identify, investigate and incubate innovative ideas.

          talk-summary: >-
            I’ve spent my career in data visualisation working in ways that are
            considered ‘wrong’ or not in line with ‘best’ practices. But by
            adhering to best practices, could we be missing out on the \*best\*
            parts of our fields through these inherent limitations? What
            creative approaches can you discover when you explicitly set out to
            do the opposite of what you are ‘supposed’ to do?


            Using examples from my creative practice, this talk is a celebration of what there is to gain when we are wilfully, perversely, and joyously ‘wrong’ in how we as designers work with our fields’ respective design processes.

          talk-title: What is Creativity?
          talk-summary: >-
            In the realm of design, creativity remains an elusive and often
            misunderstood concept. How do we define creativity, and what makes
            it so integral to the world of design and beyond? Drawing from her
            background in philosophy, psychology, and the intersection of art
            and AI, Alice Helliwell delves into the concept of creativity,
            exploring its various facets and its essential role in human
            thinking and making.


            In this stimulating talk, Alice will unravel the philosophical underpinnings of creativity, exploring definitions that go beyond artistic endeavors. Through an analytical lens, she will navigate the audience through intriguing questions surrounding creativity, such as its value, its relationship with innovation and its potential to inspire change.


            Alice's talk promises to be a thought-provoking exploration of what creativity truly means and how it can be harnessed to enhance our understanding and practice of design.
