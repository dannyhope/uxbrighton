            revisits some of those lines of enquiry that upended his career (in
            a good way). With the benefit of hindsight, some spectacular

          talk-title: T-shaped skills save lives (and products). How and why to learn
            laterally for better outcomes.
          talk-summary: >-
            Product development requires the work of lots of different people
            with different skills to deliver their best efforts. So it's natural
            we want to be the best at what we do. When those people work in
            silos and can't share ideas or communicate, products suffer.
            Creating 't-shaped' skill sets, with deep knowledge of your own
            field and insight into those around you, can help.


            Using examples from the NHS, where multidisciplinary team working is critical to patient outcomes and supported by a culture of lateral learning and knowledge sharing, Louise looks at the benefits of knowing a little about a lot for product outcomes, team working and your own career, and shares a few surprising outcomes from her own 't-shaped' approach to learning new skills.

          talk-title: Speaking the same language
          talk-summary: It sometimes feels like design and product are talking a different
            language – both striving to get great products out to their
            customers, but frequently misunderstanding each other on the path to
            get there. Kate will share the times she’s seen this happen and the
            ways she’s tackled it so that you can get ahead and create brilliant
            working partnerships with your product counterparts.

          talk-summary: We hear a lot about UX strategy but what is it and how does it
            differ from business or product strategy? Do you need it, and how do
            you go about getting it? That's a lot of questions to cover in
            twenty minutes, but Alison will make a start by calling on her
            experience of helping companies think more carefully (and
            strategically) about their customers.

          talk-summary: Product development requires trade-offs, but just like a deal with
            the devil, the devil is in the details of how you make those
            trade-offs. And your choices can be devilishly hard. This demonic
            themed talk looks at various techniques for easing the burden of the
            bargains you make.

          talk-title: Leading culture change to increase customer centricity
          talk-summary: >-
            Digital disruptors and the covid crisis have highlighted the
            importance of customer centricity. Business leaders clearly
            recognise their organisations need to be more customer centric and
            future proof them against ever-changing customer expectations,
            volatile economic conditions and aggressive digital disruptors.\

            Business leaders want to understand how to lead culture change to be more customer centric, how to implement new ways of working and how technology can enable their strategy.\

            Jonathan will talk about leading culture change to increase customer centricity, innovation and agility:


            * Working backwards from customers

            * Implications for operating models to empower small cross-functional teams.

            * How companies like Amazon, Cisco and others reinforce and change their culture.


            Jonathan’s objective is to help leaders understand their critical role increasing the focus on customer centricity.

          talk-title: YOU DON'T "GET" ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING
          talk-summary: >-
            "How do we get product managers to value user research?"


            "How do we get executives to think in an Agile way?"


            "How do we get UX researchers to prioritize our work?"


            "How do we get our sales team to stop making promises we can't deliver?"




            For the last twelve years, I have heard these questions on a weekly basis. And the answer to all of them is exactly the same: you don't "get" anyone to do anything. In this talk, product leader and author of *Product Management in Practice* Matt LeMay shares his experience working across product, UX, marketing, and leadership teams at companies like Google, Audible, Mailchimp, and Spotify. You'll learn how the path to success in cross-functional product development means embracing ego death and recognizing that you have very little direct control over anyone or anything. No, seriously.
