There are team specific meetings where we need time to overlap, the rest is flexible. Like [https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/tips/#tips-for-leaders-and-other-companies](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/tips/#tips-for-leaders-and-other-companies)\n\n**Collaborative** - just like in sports, we focus on winning!\n\n## Benefits\nWe at Fleek believe in happy employees :-)\n\n* Comprehensive healthcare coverage\n* Exclusive employee clothing drops courtesy Fleek\n* Flexible work hours & time off.

    "extended-description": "We’re looking for an Associate UX Researcher to help Wayflyer become a better informed and more empathetic organisation.\n\nYou’ll be joining a newly established research team at Wayflyer, helping people [think founder first](https://www.wayflyer.com/our-values) to build great products by putting who uses them at the heart of our design.\n\nOur products will be better and genuinely useful, solving real problems for real users, thanks to your work.\n\nAs you read this ad, if you think you tick a lot of the boxes, but not all of them, please apply anyway, especially if you’re a woman or were raised in a culture that makes you underplay your achievements.\n\n## What you’ll do\n\nAs an associate researcher, you’ll plan, design and do the work to get robust and reliable evidence about what makes our customers tick — how they do it, why they do it, what they do, what would help them do more and do it better — and share this information in a way that's easily accessible and applicable to our work.\n\nYou’ll provide hands-on support to designers, as well as help set out the longer-term vision. Your work will shape our products and services (generative research) and build confidence that we are building highly usable and useful products (evaluative research).\n\nYou’ll work across multiple teams and make sure we have a well-rounded, comprehensive understanding of our customers and users. This means that you'll get to work on a wide range of projects, often at different stages of product development and with different types of users.\n\nAs an associate, you’re at the early part of your career in research, so we’ll make sure you’ll have the support and guidance of more experienced research and design teammates, to help you develop your research expertise.\n\n## To be more specific, you’ll\n* offer helping hands to our growing team, supporting a range of projects under the guidance of more experienced designers and researchers: everything from note-taking during interviews, to video editing, to building and refining journey maps and service blueprints, to populating content for reports.\n* supplement primary research data with secondary sources wherever possible, including quantitative data.\n* lead largely independently on secondary analyses of customer data and insight as part of smaller-scope projects which you'll own and drive.\n* partner with product designers in usability testing of prototypes, leading on script writing, analysis and reporting, developing a specialism in remote unmoderated testing.\n* help to build and maintain a library of insights to make sure that understanding of our users is readily available, up-to-date and accessible to all.\n* help recruit of research participants.\n\n## Here’s what we see you doing in your first 90 days with Wayflyer\n* Interview users to support the work to create a service blueprint for the ‘get funded’ journey.\n* Support the work on customer segmentation to develop personas that describe Enterprise, Standard and Express customers in more detail, focusing on their needs and behaviours.\n* Speak with customers to support the work to create an experience map for the as-is ‘get funded’ journey for key personas.\n* Look for ways we might find a group of customers to give us regular feedback on our product and marketing designs.\n\n## You’ll be at the start of your career as a design researcher and want to learn the foundations of research from the ground up. So you’ll be\n* keen to learn from an experienced team of design practitioners who'll act as role models and mentors\n* a supportive team player who thrives on making a difference, no matter how big or small\n* attentive to detail with high standards for written content and presentations\n* able to show an awareness of the need for careful analysis of research data and insights, and the ability to produce clear findings\n* able to articulate the differences in the types of people who user Wayflyer’s products and services, and aware of their diversity\n* able to show you understand different user research methods, suggesting project-appropriate methods with growing confidence\n* able to show you understand how to design and align your work with longer-term team goals.\n* able to show you understand user-centred approaches and their role in product or service design.\n\n## Why join the Research & Design team at Wayflyer?\n\nWhen we hire someone, we hire them for being them. Their experience and skills, of course – but also who they are and how they treat people. There’s a reason why ‘Be sound’ is one of our [core values](https://www.wayflyer.com/our-values).\n\nWe’d rather not err at all, but when we do, we err on the side of being kind – being kind to ourselves and to other people.\n\nWhat that means is we respect each other as more than simply work colleagues – we recognise people have lives outside of work and sometimes the two worlds collide. That might be you needing to do the school run every morning and starting your working day later; you might need to bring your dog to the office and all your meetings because no one is at home to look after her; your brain might be an unproductive, sleepy mush after a night of looking after a poorly child; or you might not be able to attend an in-person event because you haven’t been able to arrange childcare support. All of these are real life examples from the Research & Design team. None of these are career-limiting events. All of these were worked around with no effect on quality of work.\n\nYes, we’re ambitious and we set challenging goals. But not at the expense of our personal lives or what matters to us as humans.\n\nYou should never feel the need to put on an act or hide parts of yourself. We truly want you to bring your whole self to work and we work hard to create the safe space for people to do that.\n\n## What happens next?\n\nWe want to hear from you even if you think you’re not a 100% fit, especially if you consciously or unconsciously normally shy away from celebrating your achievements.\n\nWe’ll review and respond to every application we receive. If we’re interested in taking your application further, someone from our Talent Acquisition team will be in touch to find out more about you, what you’re looking for. They’ll also share more information about the full interview process.\n\n## About Wayflyer\nOur mission is to empower eCommerce stores to unlock their full potential. Join us!\n\nWayflyer is revolutionising the eCommerce space by levelling the playing field for eCommerce founders across the world. Unlocking and fuelling their growth through solving their two biggest pain-points: funding and insights.\n\nWe use data to solve both of these challenges, empowering store owners with insights on how best to acquire customers online and providing them with short-term financing to scale and unlock their store's full potential.\n\nWe’re a fast-growing, venture-backed startup that serves a critical need for eCommerce entrepreneurs.

As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion\nImagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.\n\nWe’re so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way.

    "extended-description": "**This role can be worked remotely from the UK/EU**\n\nRail is set to dominate short and medium haul travel around the world. It’s faster, cheaper, greener and more convenient than air travel, and it cuts down on the carbon emitting congestion of road travel. With the current climate crisis it’s more important than ever to put this mode of transport at the forefront of people's minds. For every travel company having rail as a booking option is like having vegan choices on the menu – it’s a must! The trouble is, there’s been nothing modern about rail’s online customer experience… until now. \n\nWe are SilverRail, a global tech company working to solve this problem by delivering the digital infrastructure that opens up rail to the world! Our technology is powering rail and travel agencies across Europe, USA and Australia/NZ in both leisure and corporate markets, making it easy for people to choose rail and cut their carbon emissions.  \n\nAlthough we have been around for more than 10 years, and with our teams based globally in London, Boston, Brisbane and Stockholm, we still consider ourselves an agile start-up business. We are using the Scrum framework for all our software development, and we believe in ‘fail-fast-fail-early’ to find innovative solutions to complex problems. Our agility and refreshingly novel approaches mean we have already developed into a force to be reckoned with in the European market, but we have ambitions for so much more! With a raft of new clients joining us, and with our growth about to enter its prime, we aim to become the biggest player in the rail tech space. \n\n## The Role \nAs a Senior Product Designer, you’ll thrive on solving problems and participating in creating beautiful products based on user requirements and in line with the SilverRail brand. You’ll be able to work autonomously and as part of a team of designers. \n\nThe team is very collaborative, friendly and improvement oriented. Having fun while at work is a must! We support flexible remote working with occasional travel into the London office. \n\n## Key responsibilities and authorities  \n* You will be working on digital travel products with a focus on customer convenience and innovation. You will be required to take ownership of a project and lead its design, as well as helping out with other projects within the company.  \n* Build, and maintain a new design system and contribute to and help maintain existing ones \n* Gathering and evaluating user requirements, in collaboration with researchers, product managers, stake holders and engineers. \n* Illustrate ideas using storyboards, user flows and sitemaps and prototypes. \n* Identify and troubleshoot UX problems (e.g. differing native OS behaviours, diverse dynamic content across multiple markets and languages) \n* Take feedback onboard, refine designs based on user feedback and analytics \n* Reporting directly to the Design Director and the Chief Customer Officer.  \n \n## Competence and skills  \n* Ideally 5-10 years' experience as a UI & UX/product Designer, with an equal balance of beautiful and engaging UI design and thoughtful and considered UX design. . . \n* A strong portfolio, demonstrating contribution and input to projects and products. \n* Familiar with accessibility standards for digital products \n* Experience using Figma or similar is essential (As a company we use Figma, so knowledge of other similar software must be immediately transferable) \n* Experience designing/building click-through prototypes and setting usability studies/sessions. \n* The ability to work autonomously and to meet deadlines. \n* The ability to work collaboratively \n* Attention to detail & pixel perfect design, good organisation skills.  \n* Excellent visual, verbal and written communication skills. \n* Happy to take input/direction, but also to voice own opinions and contribute own ideas. \n* Knowledge or experience of rail travel and/or e-commerce is beneficial but not essential. \n \n## Why us? \n* We have an average Glassdoor grade of 4.7 and 100% recommendation rates. \n* We are an accredited flexible company and were named in Flexa’s Top 50 Most Flexible Companies \n* We utilise a hybrid working model, providing equipment for home working alongside occasional visits to our beautiful central London office. \n* We offer a highly competitive benefits package including private healthcare and Perkbox rewards, as well as stock options that give you the chance to buy into SilverRail’s future. \n* We provide a wealth of career development opportunities with training that is individual, focused on improving your skills and helping you become the best professional you can be. \n* Our team’s health and wellness is genuinely important to us, so we offer a number of wellbeing seminars, yoga classes, and membership to the #1 leading meditation app. \n* A unique opportunity to work for a tech start-up that is revolutionising the way we travel. \n \nOur values are simple: **Do Good** by working for a better tomorrow; **Think Big Act Smart** by being curious, adaptable and data-driven; and remember that through collaboration we will always be **Stronger Together**.  \n\n*We are an equal opportunities and neurodiverse employer.
