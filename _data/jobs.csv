Most technology in education is not built for the modern learning experience. It’s complex, unpredictable and no two classes are ever the same. Teachers waste time on non-teaching activities and they find it difficult to collaborate with other teachers. At Firefly, we’re freeing teachers to have a greater impact on the learning experience. Firefly allows teachers to innovate and cater to each student’s needs, preparing all students for success in the future.

**How you can help**

We already have a rich legacy, we’ve won loads of awards and have earned a reputation as the easiest to use school learning tool. But we have even greater ambitions to help every student reach their full potential. We’re at a pivotal point in what we do, with big plans for our product and exciting opportunities ahead of us. We want to work with an expert in user research so that we all understand the challenges in modern education better. With your guidance, we’ll be able to make the best decisions for our product based on what matters most to schools.

- Is empathetic towards the needs of all the different stakeholders on a project. This means being flexible and striking a balance between meticulous insights gathering, and enabling the team to take action.

*In return, you will benefit from:*

- Being able to establish the practice of User Researcher within the organisation

- Being part of a growing and thriving Product/Design organisation

- Being able to have a real impact on the usability of our products and thus aid teaching and learning.

*You have proven experience in the following:*

- This is a senior role so we are looking for someone with at least 4 years experience of hands on user research for products that have shipped.

- You have experience with a range of quantitative and qualitative methodologies such as ethnographic studies, usability testing, remote testing and survey design.

- You have lead product teams through a variety of different generative and evaluative projects.

- You have previously worked in an agile environment with a product, service or UX Design team.

- This role would be perfect for someone looking for their first senior role, especially if you’ve been working as part of a larger research team and ready to take a step up to lead the process yourself.

*Your first couple of months:*

- Lots of introductions with people and teams across the business where you can learn about our purpose, our product strategy, our process and our plans for the future.

- Learning about all the different ways we currently gather knowledge about our users.

- Visiting schools, getting to know what the modern learning experience is like.

- Absorbing the research that has been done so far to familiarise yourself with our users and areas of focus.

- Coaching the team in all the different research methods that they can call on to conduct research and solve problems themselves.

*Over time:*

- Carry out a variety of quantitative and qualitative studies with people from schools, both remote and in-person.

- Engage with third party research agencies to source participants.

- Helping us find a consistent way of storing our knowledge, making sure it is accessible to everyone, and where everyone can contribute.

- Working with the Design Lead and PMs to develop a research roadmap.

- Developing a toolkit of research methods, report templates and a shared vocabulary for our research practices.

**Our team**

You’ll be joining the Design team as the first UX Researcher. We’re a small team, but are respected across the whole company for our expertise and commitment to providing the best experience for our users. We work closely with the Product team, so we continually have the opportunity to guide and shape the direction of the product. We’re really passionate about design, and love to do meaningful work and get things done.

We aim to learn at every opportunity. We receive an annual training budget and use this to attend conferences, workshops, take online courses and have shelves full of books in our workspaces. We like to hang out together too–we go for dinner together regularly and do all sorts of activities with the wider Firefly team.

You can read a bit more about some of our recent design activities in our team blog https://medium.com/firefly-design and see a video of what it’s like to work at Firefly.

*Location, travel and flexibility:*

- We ideally want someone who is either based primarily in London (our office is in Hammersmith) or is happy to spend some of the time there.

- We are open minded about the possibility of someone who wishes to work remotely in the UK some or even most of the time. Tell us on your application and we can talk about it with you if you are short-listed.

- Some travel will be required to meet customers and attend research sessions but much of the work we do can be done remotely in the UK.

- We understand the need for flexibility due to the nature of this job so we are happy to discuss flexible working arrangements.

You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You think strategically**

You are a big–picture thinker but understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues and workshops are often your medium of choice. Your primary outputs are invariably physical rather than digital - such as walls full of post-it notes.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your findings and ideas with colleagues, peers and the community, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as JTBD or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

### Does this sound like you?

If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

# What we value
We’re a group of smart, passionate people with the support, trust and freedom to do the job we love. We’re free from the typical constraints of big agencies and have fostered a culture that encourages you to do the best and most fulfilling work of your career. There are a number of key attitudes shared by everyone at Clearleft:

**You get under the skin of problems**

You insist on a deeper understanding of the problem before rushing into solutions, even if that sometimes means starting out with ‘just enough research’. You focus on the needs of the people using your products and services, but are able to understand the complexity involved in balancing them with the client’s organisational goals or technical constraints.

**You’re a visual thinker**

You understand the benefits of making complex ideas simple through diagrams, concept maps, sketches or other visual thinking techniques. Workshops are often your medium of choice. You enjoy working through ideas with clients and colleagues, but you’re also hands-on enough to help bring those ideas into reality.

**You are articulate**

You understand that success can often rest on the quality of communication. You prefer discussion over emails and documents. You pride yourself on expressing your ideas clearly and with a strong sense of purpose that encourages trust from your colleagues and clients, whether that’s a conversation around a whiteboard, an innovative design concept or a strategy presentation in a slide deck.

**You collaborate**

You do your best work collaborating within cross–functional teams and know that shared understanding is the critical factor in achieving a successful outcome. You instinctively share your ideas with colleagues and peers, and love to see them adapt and evolve as a result of constructive criticism.

**You value outputs, but know that outcomes are what matter**

You know the best way to tackle complex problems is by remaining adaptable. You understand and respect the differences between the various research, design or development methodologies (such as Lean or Agile), while not following any practice unknowingly. You have an array of techniques to draw upon, but focus on the outcomes of your work, rather than fetishise the way it looks or how it’s delivered.

# Does this sound like you?
If so, please drop me a short email to <andy.thornton@clearleft.com>, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thorntonandy/), telling me why you’re right for this role and point to a CV, resume or portfolio of your work. We’re more interested in understanding what problems you have helped solve (and how), rather than seeing a collection of shiny deliverables. I look forward to hearing from you.

**Some things worth noting**

- Applicants should be eligible to work in the UK
- We are keeping this vacancy open until it is filled, which means there is no closing date for applications
- We endeavour to get in touch with candidates within four weeks of you contacting us, which typically begins with a casual chat prior to a more formal interview process

We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly. We’re expanding our team to make our brand (even more) famous, bringing the benefits of smarter and fairer car insurance to more motorists.

We’re looking for a talented UX/UI designer with a strong portfolio that’s interested in helping continue to build and improve a market-leading car insurance app and web platform, as well as helping shape the future of a young brand.

As car insurance is a legal requirement in the UK, it’s a product that appeals to many different types of people. Our members are from all over the country, aged from 23 through to 78, and we know we can only keep doing our best work with a diverse team that reflects that.

Working for a startup, you’ll be involved in all areas of a product lifecycle, from the initial discovery phase to supporting developers as they get your work into production. You’ll be helping with everything from building on the foundations of the brand and evolving our character, iterating on the existing UX/UI of our app, web platform, website and quote journey as well as our internal admin panel. You’ll also be creating, leading and documenting improvements to our style, UI library and design process.

In your portfolio it would be great to see examples of work all the way through the process - from wireframing through to final design. Please also share any examples of your experience in the discovery, planning and testing process.



**You will be:**

- Working closely with our Head of Brand & Product and Product Manager, leading the design of all of our external and internal products.
- The voice of digital product design within the business, interpreting objectives and goals from across the business and transforming them into fully designed end-to-end flows and concepts.
- Responsible for building on, moulding and evolving our UI guidelines and processes, continuing to build out our libraries, templates and toolkits to ensure our style is always consistent.
- Collaborating with product managers and developers within an agile/scrum sprint framework to iterate on new features and UX/UI improvements to our app, web platform, emails, website and quote site.
- Helping create and establish an efficient and scalable design system.
- Working closely with our marketing and content team to deliver features, in-app or onsite campaigns and digital design concepts to support nationwide marketing and press campaigns.
- Collaborating with freelance designers or outside agencies, where appropriate, to produce work to the same high standard as you do.
- Visualising data, infographics and illustrations for reports, pitch decks, emails and blogs.


This role will primarily be based in our London office (so wouldn't be suitable for someone looking to work remotely full time), but we're always open to remote or more flexible working arrangements if travel, childcare or something else gets in the way. This is subject to our flexible working policy, and we can discuss this in more detail if you come for interview.



**We’d like to meet someone with:**

- Experience in UX/UI design, who can share work they’ve done across apps, responsive webpages and purchase flows.
- A good attention to detail and an eye for consistency across multiple touchpoints.
- A high standard of icon and vector illustration (demonstrated by a strong portfolio) and basic experience of animation/motion graphic experience.
- The desire to work together with different teams across our business to solve problems and bounce around ideas that can improve life for our members and make our service better.
- Experience using the full Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Adobe After Effects primarily) and Sketch (for digital designs), alongside use of hand-over and prototyping tools. Experience with any other platforms will be a bonus.
- The confidence to prep, plan and run discovery workshops, planning sessions and usability workshops.


**Bonus points if you:**

- Have experience working at or with an early stage startup.
- Have a basic flair for copywriting.
- Have had any exposure (however limited) to coding, HTML or front-end development - whether that’s in website design, email building or creating banner ads.


**What are the benefits?**

- Enrolment into the By Miles pension plan after passing your three month probation.
- Local gym membership discount.
- Remote and flexible working opportunities (subject to our remote and flexible working policy).
- Personal training budget (to support professional development and certification).
- Personal book budget (so you can add to our ever-growing library).
- Access to monthly sessions with our independent coach to help with personal & professional development and wellness at work.
- Regular social events.
- Join a fast-growing and exciting startup with excellent growth opportunities.
- Work with a fun and highly-motivated team where there's never a dull moment.
- West London office (Hammersmith) with great transport links (District, Circle, Hammersmith & City and Piccadilly Lines).

At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

## About You

As a UI/UX Designer, you will help to deliver world class customer experiences for our clients, guiding them on best practice in visual design, user experience and design development, as well as delivering design outputs of your own.

* This is a client facing delivery role with a mix of advising, implementing and delivering, sometimes across multiple clients

* You’ll engage closely with the client and Scrum teams to review current design processes and methods, before making your recommendation and making it happen!

## Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:

* We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
* There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
* Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

## What we’ll offer you
Professional development. Accelerated career progression. An environment that encourages entrepreneurial spirit. It’s all on offer at Capgemini.

## Why we’re different
At Capgemini, we help organisations across the world become more agile, more competitive and more successful. Smart, tailored, often-groundbreaking technical solutions to complex problems are the norm. But so, too, is a culture that’s as collaborative as it is forward thinking. Working closely with each other, and with our clients, we get under the skin of businesses and to the heart of their goals. You will too.
Capgemini is proud to represent nearly 130 nationalities and its cultural diversity. Our holistic definition of diversity extends beyond gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, race, age and religion. Capgemini views diversity as everything that makes us who we are as an organization, including our social background, our experiences in life and work, our communication styles and even our personality.  These dimensions contribute to the type of diversity we value the most: diversity of thought.
We want to make sure that we find the right people to work in our teams, and we know that working full-time isn’t necessarily right for everyone. So we’d love to hear from you if you feel you’re a great fit for this role, and would like to work flexibly. As an example, some of our team members work four days a week, but travel across the UK during their working days. Or you might prefer to work three days a week (in a job share scenario) with travel limited to Greater London. If you are the right person for this role, we’ll find the right working approach for you.

Gousto is on a mission to change the way that people cook. We believe home cooking is important, so we’ve made it simple. We take the hassle out of planning, shopping and cooking, by delivering weekly meals with precisely measured ingredients and easy-to-follow recipes, so there’s no more ‘what’s for dinner’ panic.

As one of the most dynamic and fast-growing start-ups in the UK, Gousto currently leads the category offering more choice, more delivery options and lower lead times than any of its competitors.

This is really only the beginning though, we have big plans to transform our proposition in 2020 and beyond.

## The Team

The company is in a period of rapid growth, this is particularly true in the Product & Technology team. We are ~ 80 people currently and will be ~100 people at the end of this year with plans (and funding) to be over 220 by 2022. As part of this, Digital Product is a team with a strong culture of learning, curiosity, continuous improvement and collaborative ways of working in order to drive the commercial success of the business through better understanding and serving our customers.

The entire team at Gousto is enormously driven - We want to win this market. The environment, underpinned by our ownership principles, is highly dynamic, so everyone has measurable impact and can make a real difference.

## The Role

Our Digital Product team is split into two areas; Demand, which is all things eCommerce, plus Supply which is all things relating to our supply chain, capacity` and delivery.

Within Demand we currently have 5 product managers, which will soon be increasing. Demand is split into two Tribes. Growth (acquisition and retention) plus Menu (helping customers discover recipes they love, including the internal capabilities to do this)

This role as the Head of Product (ecommerce) is to guide and shape the evolution of Demand as we scale through 2022 and beyond, where we expect to double the engineers working across Demand.

This is a new role, reporting directly to the VP of Digital Product and taking on management of the growing team of PMs.

This role will be critical to the business, not just by shaping significant growth but by delivering on increased expectations and ambition across our digital experience and beyond.

The role will be accountable for the performance of the Product Management as a function, plus the success of the squads in which they are embedded. Through this you will;

1.  Ensure Product Teams deliver on ambitious and stretching OKRs
1.  Shape our teams and capabilities to support the growth ambitions of Gousto
1. Create an environment that promotes autonomy and accountability through those teams
 
 The role will also be responsible for taking hands on responsibility in the Menu tribe as the Product Lead. This gives the opportunity to shape the discovery and delivery of the most visible part of the Gousto digital experience.

You will be expected to contribute more broadly across the whole of Product and Technology in both the day to day and in the overall strategy. This will require working closely and collaboratively with peers, the Gousto Tech Management Team and across the whole business.

A successful candidate for the role will need to have a strong intellectual curiosity, be able to drive change into a growing and maturing teams, and be passionate about all things Product Development. Constantly driving and searching for continuous improvement/best practice in a lean, asynchronous and distributed environment.

Our ideal candidate will have a proven track record in building and scaling successful Product teams. We want someone with excellent leadership skills and a solid understanding of what it takes to design and deliver products customers love, which in turn drive commercial success.

A key requirement for the role will be a strong ability to build relationships and communicate at all levels - this role will equally need to influence an Engineering team plus Gousto’s Management and Leadership teams.

Most importantly we’re keen to shape the role around the successful candidate, their strengths and the experience they need to help shape their career.

# Department Overview
 
The world of payments is changing rapidly. New innovative technologies are being developed to meet the changing needs but these can give rise to new threats to users of the payments system, and to the stability of that system as a whole. This means that we need ever stronger protections and more resilient infrastructure.


The Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) lies at the heart of UK payments.  In total, RTGS settles around £650bn of payments each working day, close to a third of the UK’s annual GDP. The RTGS infrastructure is over 20 years old and, despite its excellent operational record, it needs to be modernised and developed to meet today’s needs. Balancing the safeguarding of stability whilst enabling innovation.



The [RTGS Renewal Programme](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-renewal-programme) has been established to develop the next generation of the Bank of England’s Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system.  The way payments are made has changed dramatically in recent years, reflecting changes in the needs of households and companies, changes in technology, and an evolving regulatory landscape.  The range of payment providers is growing rapidly.  Given the implications of these changes for the Bank’s mission and for users, businesses and regulators, it is important that the Bank consider how RTGS will need to evolve to meet and shape payments trends in the coming decades.



The Programme is now in the Design-Enable-Procure (DEP) stage.  After having defined the Programme scope, with input from the payments industry, we are running a procurement process under the Official Journal of the European Union to appoint a Technology Delivery Partner.  They will work with the Bank on the design and build of the core settlement engine.  We plan to enter the contract with the Technology Delivery Partner in Summer 2020. During this DEP stage, we have been working closely with internal and external stakeholders impacted by the change and have looked to deliver early benefits and increased resilience where possible.  

 



# Job Description



Reporting to the Lead Software Assurance Architect, you will be responsible for defining User Experience patterns, Standards and Policies in support of the whole RTGS solution. You will work closely with relevant business stakeholders, product owners and developers to transform the current user journeys into a crisp and simplified experience. You will also be working closely with our Technical Delivery Partner and the wider Bank to align design standards across all of the different components of the RTGS system.



The Bank is investing in building an experienced design and engineering team who will be responsible for building and operating the renewed RTGS service. The User Experience and User Interface design and implementation will be a key component of this service.

Gravity Sketch is a London-based startup that is shaking up the 3D design space and transforming the future of digital creation. Just like Adobe revolutionised 2D design, our vision is to revolutionise 3D design today. Backed by high profile VCs and investors from Silicon Valley, London and Tokyo, we are developing the first enterprise-grade immersive 3D design and collaboration software which allows designers, engineers, and other stakeholders to create remotely together, in real-time, across multiple devices and platforms. We aim to transform the future of digital creation through disrupting the current design and engineering workflows, placing the user at the center of the creation process. Our product is used by thousands of designers in industries such as automotive, apparel and film, across North America, Europe, and Asia.

## Responsibilities

You will work with the product team, users and the Customer Success team to understand the software inside out & build a deep understanding of the vision of Gravity Sketch, who we imagine users to be, who they really are, and how we can help them. 

You will gather research on our users & customer base in a variety of ways (including a deep dive through the existing customer feedback & Discord channel)  in order to understand issues they are having with the software, what the root cause of their issues are, and how we can solve problems in a “Gravity Sketch” way. This will involve logging the feedback from the research above in an organized way and logging requests from existing customer feedback and Discord feedback channel. 

You’ll have an opportunity to take an active part in discussions about users, new features, and development challenges we might face in solving problems, and conduct interviews with our clients & power users, then collate and use that feedback. 
Test and coordinate with users that are testing new features and prototypes, and be an active part in discussions around what works/doesn’t work, good/bad, pro/con

## Role Progression

As you continue to grow in the role, you will work with the product team to come up with briefs to solve problems, and help us build, define, and come up with best practices of the Gravity Sketch design philosophy and a design culture across the company

Over time, you’ll work closely with the engineering team and design team to break down which problems and solutions we should tackle, how to solve user problems in an effective way. You will figure out the low hanging fruit, but also how we can schedule in larger scale improvements to the application. 

For personal & professional development, you will actively learn Unity in order to enhance your prototyping abilities, with the goal to work closely with our design  and engineering teams to create prototypes within our proof of concept developments on various features and areas of the software.

Simply Business is well prepared to deal with unprecedented events. We’re an agile business by nature – and our hiring and interview process is no exception. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some parts of our hiring process may take a little longer than usual.  Please bear with us, and rest assured that we're happy to hear from you and receive your application.

If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone. If you don’t have access to either of these, or you need support with your application, get in touch with us at careers@simplybusiness.co.uk. Similarly, please email us if you’re not well, you’re self-isolating, or if you want to pause your application for a bit – we’ll be happy to keep you updated on future opportunities like the one below.

Technology. Award-winning customer service. Bleeding-edge data ability. Simply Business is a new type of insurance company, using all of the above to create the best possible insurance experience for small businesses and self-employed people. We love working here, and have even taken the number one spot in the Sunday Times Best Company To Work For 2015 and 16 lists; we’ve stopped entering now to focus on a few bigger projects, but you get the idea.

It’s a great place to work.

There are currently over 500,000 active Simply Business insurance policies in the UK alone. And we have offices in London, Northampton and Boston, USA. Talking of offices, ours are bright, airy and geared up for really smart working. We’re flexible, with plenty of remote workers coming in and out, and we believe work and life should be hand in hand, rather than a juggling act. So no need to worry about school pick-ups, or a horrible commute.

Our people are our most important asset, so we focus on building a working  life that helps us thrive, not stick. Join us and you’ll be part of our journey  to creating something even better, for our customers and ourselves.

We’re looking for an experienced digital Product Designer to help us redefine how insurance works for the entrepreneurs and small business owners who are the lifeblood of the UK and US economies. You’ll lead design within a cross functional product team focused on attracting new audiences to our global platform which already provides tailored, transparent insurance to over half a million businesses and landlords. Sitting in our talented Customer Experience Team you will have the support of teammates skilled in user research, customer insight, behavioural science and product design.

## You should apply if:
* you can demonstrate how you obsess equally over the definition of the problem as you do the precision of the pixels
* you’ve a relentless curiosity with people; the decisions they make and why they make them
* your work shows empathy for customer needs, consideration of technical constraints and a focus on the business value of your solutions
* you’ve experience working on experiments with user researchers, and are able to identify the most appropriate use of qualitative and quantitative studies to inform design decisions
* you embrace collaboration and perform your best when you involve your product team in the design process
* you encourage feedback on your work and carefully consider how you ensure the feedback you offer to team members is useful
* you care about inclusive design and will ensure that accessibility standards are maintained as we evolve our design system
* you can show us a portfolio with detailed examples of beautiful interface design showing a command of design details such as layout, typography, colour, iconography, spacing and motion
* you are expert at using all the usual design software including Sketch, Figma, Zeplin, Invision and Principle

## What are the benefits?

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call ‘core benefits’. On top of that, you can pick and choose from the more exciting options we offer – whether it’s a full gym membership or gym subsidy, comprehensive private health cover, extra holiday, or a National Trust pass. 

**The ‘core’ stuff**
Some of these will kick in once you’re confirmed in post, but here’s the summary:
* a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day, generous annual leave
* life assurance (financial cover for your family, should the worst happen)
* a cash plan to reimburse your everyday medical expenses
* an extra day off if you get married or move house
* an automatic enrollment pension (employer-matched at 5%) 

**The fun stuff**
We also have a great deal more to pick and mix from, with things like:
* a full gym membership
* private medical insurance
* extra days annual leave
* shopping vouchers
* dental insurance
* travel insurance

But there’s so much more to Simply Business than insurance and memberships. We also commit to flexible working options, smart working (our offices are kitted out for you to work when and how you choose), cycle to work, eye test vouchers, and season ticket loan schemes, and we have a handy online form to put in any training or conference requests.

Best of all, though, are the groups, clubs, and adventures that come with the Simply Business territory. Forget a simple Give As You Earn scheme (although we’ve got that too) – we trek the Sahara for charity, take you on weekends away, throw epic summer parties, and meet up for book groups, public speaking coaching, yoga, manicures, beer brewing, and lots, lots more.

## Our values

Everything we do comes down to these five values – empowerment, authenticity, simplicity, learning and pioneering. In practice, these will mean something unique to every  person at Simply Business, but if you’re considering working here, give them some thought. They’re at the heart of our story.

### Empowerment
We believe in our people and the positive impact they can have so we enable everyone to stretch themselves

### Authenticity
We celebrate diversity, avoid jargon and genuinely care about helping small businesses thrive

### Simplicity
We attempt to simplify complex solutions to save our customers time and effort

### Learning
We’re never done learning about new possibilities and act to explore them

### Pioneering
We’re obsessed with finding new ways to create even better  experiences

Panaseer is changing the face of enterprise security. Our platform helps businesses make informed, risk-based security decisions and substantiate regulatory compliance. We've won numerous awards, including the [Editor’s Choice award from Cyber Defence Magazine](https://panaseer.com/press-releases/panaseer-wins-at-infosec-awards-during-rsa-conference-2020/) at the RSA Conference 2020.

The Panaseer platform takes data from security, IT and business solutions to build trusted asset inventories, identify gaps in security controls and arm both security teams and executives with metrics that enable them to make decisions. By automating security control monitoring and reporting it helps Security, Risk and IT teams collaborate more effectively and answer the most challenging questions they face. Questions like: ‘How secure are our organisation's most critical assets?’, and ‘Where do I prioritise my limited resources for best effect?’ Design is often ignored in security products, but recent feedback from our customers confirmed that design and user experience are key differentiators for Panaseer.

Sound good? We're on the lookout for enthusiastic designers with fresh perspectives to help us deliver the Panaseer vision.

Most days you’ll be in East London (we have a cool Tech office with a running track, table tennis, drinks fridge etc… sort of thing you’d expect from the world’s number one sports betting and gaming business). **Check it out [here]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2ZkHwBvEQU&feature=youtu.be).

*Despite the current circumstances we are still actively recruiting for roles. In compliance with UK Government advice relating to COVID-19 this role will be remotely based in line with our current workforce and we will supply you with the tools and technologies to enable you to do so. Similarly all interviews will be conducted by google hangouts or equivalent video conferencing technologies.*

It's a particularly exciting time for Product at Which? as we drive forward our ambitious transformation programme, putting users at the heart of every product we create evolving our technologies to deliver best in class user experiences. Over the next twelve months we will be developing both our commercial and advocacy product offering, trialing new ways of working and driving innovative approaches  at every opportunity.

## What will I be doing?

This is a varied role and no two days will be the same. You'll be part of the UXDR team and involved with two squads in a fast paced agile environment. As the squad's dedicated User Experience Researcher, you'll be involved at each stage of the design process, from discovery research that will shape the squad's strategy, to proposition validation, and evaluation of the product. What's more the research that you do will be fundamental to our user-centred approach, and you'll see your insights come to life as they are implemented across our products.

You'll have the opportunity to speak with a wide range of people both inside and outside of the business, from in-house Designers and Product Managers to prospective students and expectant mothers. You'll take ownership of your projects, working closely with the UX team and Product Managers to generate new opportunities for research.

While we maintain social distancing, those activities could include diary studies, remote unmoderated tests, and remote interviews. When we are allowed to see other people again, the techniques could then involve face-to-face interviews, contextual enquiries, and any other methodology that you feel could address the squad's needs. The rest is really up to you. You will have the scope to get involved in side projects, such as setting up an onsite testing environment, trying out emerging research techniques and mentoring other team members. 

To enable you to do all the above, we will equip you with the tools you need to run research remotely (i.e. Video Conferencing, UserTesting.com, OptimalWorkshop) and, as long as it is deemed safe form COVID-19, the resources to run research in-person (e.g. a purpose built lab, recording equipment for in-field research).  

## What's the team like?

You'll be joining an established UX and Design team of 14 consisting of User Researchers, UX Designers and Digital Designers. There is a real cross section of skill-sets within the team from deep technical experts to those that take a more strategic approach. The team are respected for their expertise, guide and shape our product offering and have real influence at a strategic level. Innovative and open to new approaches they have successfully established and embedded new ways of working that ensure the customer is at the heart of decision making. We encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing and we hope that you will enjoy working as part of an energetic and passionate team that like to get things done!

## What we're looking for:

As a driven user advocate you will:

* need to have solid experience of running user interviews and usability testing. (Any experience of remote user testing would be a great benefit, but not essential for your application).
* have some experience of quantitative methods as well, and have the ability to synthesize qualitative and quantitative insights to provide compelling recommendations.
* be motivated to run projects autonomously and be proactive in involving different teams in gathering, sharing and presenting insights. 
* have the drive to seek out new research opportunities and be adaptable to support different research needs, keeping ahead of best practices, new methodologies and tools. 

## What we'll give you in return

When we're back in the office you'll find it modern, relaxed and friendly (including fresh fruit, subsidised canteen, great facilities for cyclists and lunchtime runners, two free healthy meals per week and a roof terrace to enjoy them on). We have a 35 hour working week and offer flexible working with each team working one day from home (prior to lockdown).

There are excellent benefits including 28 days annual leave, private healthcare, and excellent pension scheme (and the usuals... Cycle to Work, season ticket loan scheme etc.) We even have access to a private section of Regent's park which is handy for hot summers and team building events!

**At Which? we value diversity and we're committed to creating an inclusive culture where everyone is able to be themselves and to reach their full potential. We want to receive applications from people of all backgrounds and cultures and believe that a diverse workforce helps us to understand and create a positive impact for consumers. We want to ensure that everybody can apply and be part of our recruitment processes, and therefore when required we make reasonable adjustments to accommodate our candidates.**

Our UX Design team is integral to this – working with researchers, product owners, software engineers and others to get the heart of customer needs, and designing and testing solutions that are ready for changing customer expectations. 
Initially, you’ll be focused on our growing portfolio of money products – think credit cards, loans, current accounts, savings, mortgages, and more.

It’s an area we know we have a massive opportunity to grow in, so you’ll be joining one of our newest “mobs” – the collective name for a group of meerkats – in a team of research, design, and optimisation, working alongside our product teams to make money simple for our customers.

You’ll be the senior designer in your mob, so we will need you to guide and coach others in design thinking and practices, within both the design and product community!

You’ll also be part of our wider design team, which currently consists of 12 designers, but is set to grow to 24 by this time next year! There are plenty of opportunities for coming together, sharing, and growing here (even remotely!)

And remember, we’re not just about form filling – our design team is working across our mobile app, content, design system, and new features that will help reduce the burden of admin on customers.

We’ve also got the benefit of an in-house research lab, where (under normal circumstances!) designers and researchers work together to really hear what our customers think of us! And during lockdown, we have an array of remote research tools at our disposal.
Our design team has been growing for the last three years, and we’re ready to expand further. We want designers who are passionate about solving problems for customers, collaboration, and ultimately designing delightful, usable, and empowering new products across different platforms.

If that sounds like you, then let’s talk.

## What will it take to be successful?

* Senior UX Designer with a portfolio (in any format) to illustrate
* Confident to lead and guide less experienced designers
* Proficient with Sketch/Figma (for wireframing and design), Axure (for prototyping), and InVision (or equivalents) 
* Experience in working with design systems is highly desirable. We are currently building our new design system, and this role will play a key role in utilising design components, as well as feeding in new ideas to our design systems team.
* Evidence of playing a leading role UX process delivery applied to different projects – research, ideation, sketching, prototyping and delivery for example
*  Experience with customer research methods to understand customer needs and validate/challenge design and experience decisions
* Experience collaborating with product owners, researchers and software engineers to deliver successful experience designs
*  Native mobile UX experience is highly desirable but not essential

We’re hugely proud to be the world’s leading independent rail and coach travel platform and rank among the highest-rated travel and ticketing apps globally. Today, we offer our customers travel to thousands of destinations in and across 45 countries in Europe and beyond. That’s more than £3.7 billion in ticket sales annually, and over 96 million visits to our apps and websites each month. In another major milestone, last summer Trainline listed on the London Stock Exchange and is now part of the FTSE 250.
 
Our culture is central to our success. We’re driven to sustain our phenomenal growth from recent years, and this means we’re always working closely and collaboratively to turn our ideas into reality. It’s this sense of pace, innovating and improving pretty much everything we do, that makes Trainline so exciting and unique - we truly believe our work has a genuine impact and will change travel for the better.

The goals are ambitious and the mandate is clear – to make travel more personal.
 
As a Product Designer, you will champion the need to deeply understand customer needs and craft beautiful, easy to use solutions to meet them. With a strong understanding of interaction design and a love for how visual design complements that, you will support the design experience through the full product process. You’ll be in your element throwing ideas in to help us discover the next big thing, undertaking detailed UX iterations based on customer testing, or designing jaw-dropping visual interactions.  
  
You’ll be joining our App team focused on pioneering a great native experience for customers across the UK and international markets and helping them to book, travel and keep coming back. Due to differences across markets and languages, you’ll tackle complex user-problems to ensure that every experience feels local.

## Experience 
  
We’re looking for creative big thinkers with small egos who want to build relevant and long-lasting solutions on behalf of millions of customers. As a passionate design professional, you’ll be someone who leans more to the visual design end of the spectrum, but can still hold their own at all stages of the design process. Similarly, experience in native app design and the nuances between Apple and Google platforms are critical. You’ll be used to participating in design workshops and will bring a user centred design approach to everything you do. You’ll know what ‘great’ looks like and drive towards that relentlessly. 
  
You enjoy complex design challenges, validating ideas with data and customer research, and understand that success is positively impacting customer behaviour, not just about shipping a release.
