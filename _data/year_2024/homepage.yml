          talk-title: Human conversations with grids of numbers
          talk-summary: >-
            The rise of large language models signals a new era in machine
            learning. Yet, these grids of numbers, while impressive, offer a
            faltering facade of true human communication. Past research reminds
            us that conversation is a beautiful, chaotic, and profoundly human
            tool that resists easy replication.


            However, there is a seed in generative AI of something to come: tools that can generate individualised and ethereal interactions. Emerging reasoning capabilities that can interact with the experiences we have built for humans, which act as agents on our behalf. These systems hold the promise of eventually working in collaboration with us, through our greatest tool – spoken and written language.


            In this talk Glenn will explore possible AI driven user experiences. What will be the place for graphical interfaces in a world of conversational AI? Will chat UI design patterns prove to be just a passing adolescent phase – something we'll all soon look back on with a wry smile.
