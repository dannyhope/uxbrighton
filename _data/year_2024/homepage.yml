            Amplify Creativity and Career – Dr Philip Bonhard"
          talk-summary: >-
            AI is all the rage, isn’t it? You can’t read the news without
            someone proclaiming it to be the best thing since sliced bread or
            the bringer of doom. But what does it really do and how will it
            affect your job? If ChatGPT can generate a business proposal for a
            start-up in the tone of voice of Coca-Cola ads and generate a
            website to go with it — will we need copywriters and designers in
            the future?


            In this talk, Phill will explore what designers need to know about AI beyond the hype, how they can stand out from the crowd, and what they should do right now to stay relevant and 10x their productivity. AI will be many things, but it should be an opportunity for growth!

            at Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s biggest home purchase lender. In a
            nutshell, his teams are responsible for considering human needs
            before jumping to solutions and then helps to get the right
            designers on board, like UX, Service, Visual Designers and
            researchers.


            Before that, he headed up Experience Design for the Economic Crime Prevention Platform, which included all matters fincrime, Fraud and Authentication. Prior to joining Lloyds, Phil worked in academia, big consulting firms and ran his own design agency. He holds a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from University College London.


            Most importantly he’s passionate about designing products and services that make people’s lives better. He also likes to build stuff for his three little children and tinker with his raspberry pie/arduino board with the occasional Lego thrown in. He strongly believes that building/prototyping stuff and experimenting is more important than describing it.

          talk-title: The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI
          talk-summary: The web is becoming an eerily lifeless place. Its public spaces
            are filled with a mix of bad faith actors and automated predators
            like bots, advertisers, clickbait attention-grabbers, and angry
            twitter mobs. Like a dark forest, all the living creatures are
            quietly hiding out of sight. Generative AI systems are about to make
            this situation worse. We now have tools that can churn out tens of
            thousands of words, images, and videos in seconds. The volume of
            mundane, low-quality, and uninspired content published to the web is
            about to explode. How will we find original insights under this pile
            of cruft? How will we figure out which authors are flesh-and-blood
            humans we can form emotional and intellectual relationships with?
            And does it even matter if something was made by an AI instead of a
            human?

          talk-summary: >-
            'I am large, I contain multitudes' said Walt Whitman. Multimodal
            models contain all of humanity's digitised organic reality. From
            deep web forums to all social, YouTube, product reviews, websites,
            and scientific publications… all make up a primordial soup we use to
            recreate ourselves so we can best simulate and predict organic
            behaviour.


            We are creating a digital reflection of humanity, capturing the nuances of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviours.


            We can delve into the complexities of human psychology, and understand motivations, biases, and preferences. We are not only using this knowledge to predict future behaviour, and personalise experiences, but also to develop new products and services. 


            In this talk, Kwame will take us on a three-part journey on how to think about Synthetic Users —  where we are and what future is being desired and created. All through the lens of having built Synthetic Users and a few other companies.

He created Planet Centric Design methodology at Impossible.com and helped kickstart ventures like Fairphone.com, TheVinylFactory.com (to take a break from digital), Enchufada.com, and many others.

            In this session Ewa (UX Designer) & Manú (UX Researcher) will talk
            us through a variety of case studies from AI powered products which
            have successfully built calibrated trust in their users.


            Taking their own experience building an AI search tool for seasoned experts in patent intelligence as the starting point.


            Exploring three key elements for building user trust:


            **How to explain how your product works**


            * It’s not about how an AI makes a decision, it’s why

            * Case study: Derwent Innovation’s AI search


            **How to ‘humanise’ your AI product to build trust**


            * Case study: ChatGPT

            * How to harness good bias to personalise your AI: Feedback, training on the fly & data sources


            **How to teach users to use the Al product correctly**


            * Responding to actions

            * Error messages

          talk-title: Human conversations with grids of numbers
          talk-summary: >-
            The rise of large language models signals a new era in machine
            learning. Yet, these grids of numbers, while impressive, offer a
            faltering facade of true human communication. Past research reminds
            us that conversation is a beautiful, chaotic, and profoundly human
            tool that resists easy replication.


            However, there is a seed in generative AI of something to come: tools that can generate individualised and ethereal interactions. Emerging reasoning capabilities that can interact with the experiences we have built for humans, which act as agents on our behalf. These systems hold the promise of eventually working in collaboration with us, through our greatest tool – spoken and written language.


            In this talk Glenn will explore possible AI driven user experiences. What will be the place for graphical interfaces in a world of conversational AI? Will chat UI design patterns prove to be just a passing adolescent phase – something we'll all soon look back on with a wry smile.
