# Introduction

UX Brighton is a community [group of volunteers](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/about/), led by [Danny Hope](http://dannyhope.co.uk/). We’re always looking for curators for our bi-monthly evening events. If there’s a UX or UX-related event that you’d like to see, then volunteer to run it yourself.

We will deal with all the logistical aspects of the event, including finding, booking and paying for a venue (we normally use [Fabrica](http://fabrica.org.uk/), [Pub Du Vin](https://www.hotelduvin.com/locations/brighton/pub-du-vin) or [68 Middle Street](http://68middle.st/), depending on the capacity required and the venue availability).

You’ll need to find two or three speakers for the evening and help to promote the event.

We’ll add you to the [UX Brighton Slack](http://uxbri.slack.com/) evening-events channel, where other curators will be on-hand to offer support and answer any questions you may have.

This page will walk you through all the steps you need to take, to get your event up and running.

# Choose your topic for the evening

What’s the evening going to be about? As well as regular UX-focused evenings, we’ve had more participatory events and even some workshops. Decide what your topic will be and then [get in touch with us](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk).

We aim to run an event every other month, so you’ll have at least a couple of months to get your planning and promotion done. Our evening events are always on the second Tuesday of the month.

# Find your speakers

Once we’ve confirmed your event, you’ll need to start thinking about who will be speaking. It would be unusual for you to speak at your own event, but if you are keen to do this, [drop us a line anyway](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk). We’d still expect you to find at least one other speaker for the evening.

You might already know who would make a great speaker, and you might even have approached them already, in which case, that’s great! But more often than not, finding and confirming speakers is where you’ll need to put some work in.

Please bear in mind that we’re a voluntary community group, so unlike paid-conferences, are unable to offer speaker stipends. We can sometimes help with local travel (e.g. a London to Brighton return train fare), but even then, ideally your speakers would already be in Brighton, or able to make their own way here.

In the next section, we’ll look at ways of finding people to speak at your event.

## Make a potential speaker long-list

Your long list is absolutely everyone you can think of, who might make a great speaker. Gather email addresses, Twitter handles and other ways you might be able to get in touch.

Don’t forget to ask on the [evening-events channel](https://uxbri.slack.com/archives/evening-events) - other curators and UX Brighton volunteers will probably be able to suggest speakers or companies you could approach, and may even be able to introduce you to potential speakers.

Contact everyone on your list, as early as possible and ask them if they’d like to speak about your topic, and also if they could recommend someone they know, who might be interested. It’s worth reiterating this; people may be unable to speak for a variety of reasons, but are often more than happy to introduce you to someone who might be able to.

### Sample email to potential speakers

Here’s a sample email you could send to an organisation that might have speakers relevant to your evening. Ideally you would send this to someone you already know at that company.

<aside> ✉️ Subject: Looking for speakers for `<your topic>`

> Hi `<name of your potential speaker>`,

I'm emailing on behalf of UX Brighton, a voluntary group in Brighton that runs monthly evening events around different UX topics: [](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/)<http://uxbrighton.org.uk/>.

I'm organising an event on `<the date of your event>`, on the theme of "`<the theme of your event>`" and it would be fantastic if we could have someone from `<your speaker’s company>` give a talk about `<the way the person or company is related to the theme of your event>`.

Typically, there are two speakers, each presenting for 10-20 minutes, with a break in between. We tend to have around 60-80 people in the audience, although this can sometimes be closer to 100, depending on the popularity of the event.

The talks are filmed, and then made freely available on the UX Brighton website. Here's a set of talks from our event on Human Factors & Ergonomics: [](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/ergonomics/)<http://uxbrighton.org.uk/ergonomics/>.

Brighton has a thriving digital community; the talks are well-attended both by locals and people who travel specially for our evening events. Brighton is home to some well-known agencies, games companies, mobile developers and startups.

It would be great to know if you would be interested in sending a speaker, or if you could recommend a colleague who might be interested.

Regards and please feel free to email or call me with any questions

**`<your name, email and, ideally, mobile number>.`**

### Sample Twitter DM you could send to a potential speaker

Are there people on Twitter that you think would make good speakers? You could DM them something like this:

<aside> <img src="<https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/40dcf5bf-ee3c-451a-a820-42e080668342/Twitter-logo-2012-512x512.png>" alt="<https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/40dcf5bf-ee3c-451a-a820-42e080668342/Twitter-logo-2012-512x512.png>" width="40px" /> Hi,

I'm organising a UX Brighton evening event (**`<date of your event>`**), around the theme of "**`<your event theme>`**". I want to give the attendees a broad overview of the issues around **`<your event theme>`**.

Our events are volunteer run, have about 60-80 attendees and are typically focused around a single UX theme; e.g. our event on Human Factors & Ergonomics: [](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/ergonomics/)<http://uxbrighton.org.uk/ergonomics/>.

I’m looking for two speakers. The talks are between 10–20 minutes each and it would be great to have you as one of the speakers...

</aside>

### Sample reply to a *“No, I can’t/don’t want to speak”* response

Some people are bound to say no. Don’t be disheartened! Send them back something like this:

Thanks for getting back to me; it’s a real shame that you can’t make it.

Could you recommend a colleague or contact that you think would make a good speaker and would be interested in coming? It would be great if you could introduce me to them...

## Ask your friends and contacts

Let people know that you’re running the event. As well as the speaker long-list, make a list of all your friends and contacts who might be able to help you find a speaker. Ask these people if they can recommend anyone. Here’s a sample message you might send:

Hi! I’m organising a @uxbri event around **<the theme of your event>** - can you recommend or put me in touch with anyone who you think might make a good speaker? They can get in touch with me at **<your email address>**, **<your** **twitter handle>.** Thanks!

## Use the event to find your second speaker

As soon as you have your first speaker, the UX Brighton volunteers will help you get an event page up.

We’ll need an overview of the event’s theme and details of your first speaker. Don’t forget to ask them to provide a short bio, explaining why they’re a good speaker for your topic, plus a photo. Then, once the event page is up on [](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/)<http://uxbrighton.org.uk>, we’ll tweet about it and you can start asking people in your network to promote the event.

Open your email contacts and Bcc: something like the following message to everyone you think might be vaguely interested. Be sure to mention that you’re still looking for a second speaker...

<aside> ✉️ Subject: **<topic of your event>** - the next UX Brighton evening event

> Hi,

Could you help me promote this to your networks? I’m actively looking for a second speaker for the evening - if you could recommend or introduce me to someone you think would be keen to speak, that would be great!

If you do nothing else, forwarding on this email or a RT of **`<URL of tweet announcing your event>`** would be very welcome![http://uxbrighton.org.uk/](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/)**`<your event page>`**/**`<date of your event>`** 7-9pm

This event **`<short description of your event’s topic>`** Thinking of coming? If you're a designer, UX-person, copy-writer, web or mobile app-developer, a product-owner or anyone who's interested in **`<your topic>`**, then you should definitely come!**`<Eventbrite ticket URL>`**

Thanks!

</aside>

With a bit of work you’ll definitely find at least two speakers. But that said, it’s always worth have a third person as a backup, in case someone drops out before the event.

# Promoting your event

Now you’ve confirmed your two speakers, it’s time to put bums on seats.

You’ll already have sent a first round of emails, tweets and DMs to people when you got your first speaker and your event-page went live on [uxbrighton.org.uk](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/).

Now that you know who your second speaker is, it’s time to tweet an announcement about them too:

<aside> <img src="<https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e8534eea-0288-4d46-b282-7b66630292e0/Twitter-logo-2012-512x512.png>" alt="<https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e8534eea-0288-4d46-b282-7b66630292e0/Twitter-logo-2012-512x512.png>" width="40px" /> Just confirmed - @uxperson will be speaking alongside @otheruxperson at the **`<your event topic>`** Tues `<**date of your event>**` 7 PM. [uxbri.org](http://uxbri.org)

</aside>

## Get your speakers to promote the event to their networks

Ask your speakers to help get the word out about the event. You could do this when you follow-up with them about getting a headshot and a short bio:

Subject: Speaker bios and event promotion

Hiya,

Thanks again for agreeing to speak! Could you please let me have a short bio, a title for your talk and a brief outline of it.

If you’ve got a headshot you could send me or let me have the URL for, that would be great too.

Please could you also help promote the event to your networks, either by email, any mailinglists you’re on, or by Twitter (a retweet of this would be a great start: `<URL of tweet announcing your speaker line-up>`)

## Get out your address book again

Remember earlier we suggested that you Bcc: a whole load of people when you were looking for a second speaker? Do it again, but this time let everyone know you’ve found your speakers and that your event is go.

Ideally you’ll personalise this for people who got back to you and helped you out, but you can still Bcc: anyone else you think might be able to help:

> Subject: **`<topic of your event>`** - the next UX Brighton evening event
>
> We’ve now confirmed both speakers for **`<topic of your event>`!**

Could you help me promote this to your networks?

If you do nothing else, forwarding on this email or a RT of **`<URL of tweet announcing your event>`** would be very welcome![http://uxbrighton.org.uk/](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/)**`<your event page>`**/**`<date of your event>`** 7-9pm

This event **`<short description of your event’s topic>`**

Thinking of coming? If you're a designer, UX-person, copy-writer, web or mobile app-developer, a product-owner or anyone who's interested in **`<your topic>`**, then you should definitely come!**`<ticket URL>`**

Thanks!

# See what our previous curators have to say...

> Curating UX Brighton events has been the perfect way to see talks on the topics I’ve been most interested in! —Danny Hope
>
> *Curating my first UX Brighton event was nerve-wracking at first but well worth the effort. It provides a unique opportunity to give something back to the community (and as a side-effect, helps to raise your own profile). Introducing the subject matter and the speakers on the evening also gives you an opportunity to speak in front of around 100 people without having to write your own talk! This in turn makes other speaking engagements (stakeholder interviews, workshops etc.) more and more comfortable. Really it’s all win!* —Tim Minor
