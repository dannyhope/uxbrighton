## About UX Brighton

<p class="standfirst">Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks around a single theme.</p>

Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.

    <h3 id="a-boutique-team">A boutique team</h3>
    <p>UX Brighton is carefully curated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyhope/">Danny Hope</a>, a UX consultant with two decades of experience. Event Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-mpage/">Annie-Marie Page</a> ensures the conference runs like a smoothly oiled machine. Danny and Annie-Marie are backed up by a team of volunteers who all work to ensure the conference is a great day for all our attendees, speakers and sponsors.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in sponsoring, please email <a href="mailto:anniemarie@uxbri.org" class=" bold">anniemarie@uxbri.org</a> or DM <a href="https://twitter.com/direct_messages/create/uxbri" class=" bold">@uxbri</a> (DMs are open).</p>
    <h3 id="unique-venue">Unique venue</h3>
    <p>The Brighton Dome is part of the historical and beautiful Pavilion estate, home to Prince George, the Prince Regent. Originally his riding school and stables, the Concert Hall is a stunning 1200 seated theatre. We’ve been holding our conference here since 2011 and love it’s unique brand of Brighton quirkiness.</p>
    <p>The spacious, double-heighted Foyer Bar provides an excellent space for our sponsors. It’s also where our delegates congregate for refreshments, so they won’t miss you!</p>

    <h3 id="why-sponsor-us-">Why sponsor us?</h3>
    <p>Brand visibility, networking, hiring quality people, brand association.</p>
    <p>Our delegates want to engage with companies that support us. They are looking for new jobs, resources and tools. The UX community share their knowledge widely. So our supporters will reap the benefits long after the conference ends.</p>
    <h3 id="custom-sponsorship-deal">Custom sponsorship deal</h3>
    <p>As you might expect, we're a creative bunch, so encourage our sponsors to think beyond the exhibition stand.</p>
