You can buy tickets for most of our events by invoice.

## Details we need

Please send the following details to [events@uxbri.org](mailto:events@uxbri.org):

**Company details** (so we can properly address the invoice)

* Name & email address of the person to invoice
* Contact phone number
* Company name
* Company address
* VAT number

**Ticket details** (so that we can calculate the total)

* Number of tickets
* The name of the event

**Details for each attendee** (so that we can issue their tickets)

* First name
* Last name
* Email
* Company name
* Job title

## Payment terms

For tickets purchased at a promotional price, payment must be completed by the promotional offer’s expiration date. For instance, if you purchase Early bird tickets that are discounted until February 5, your payment must be finalised by February 5 to secure the discounted rate.

## Receiving tickets

When purchasing tickets in bulk, please note that our ticketing system only allows us to send the tickets to the purchaser‘s email address. We recommend forwarding the tickets to all attendees as needed.
