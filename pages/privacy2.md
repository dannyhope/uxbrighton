## Cookies

To make this website work properly, and to provide the most relevant products and services to our site visitors, we place small data files called cookies on your device. This policy provides you with information about cookies and how to control them for this website.

### What is a Cookie?

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, to develop a record of the user’s online activity. Cookies on this site may be delivered in a first-party (set by the UX Brighton website) or third-party (set by another website) – or they may also be set in association with emails you receive from us.

Cookies help us enhance your experience when using the website. They also help us understand how people use our site, such as which pages are most popular, so that we can better serve our site users and members.

### First-party Cookies

When using our website, you may encounter embedded content, such as YouTube videos, or you may be directed to other websites. These websites and embedded content may use their own cookies.
