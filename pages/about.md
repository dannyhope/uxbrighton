UX Brighton is a community group disseminating knowledge about all aspects of user experience, founded in 2008.

Our evening events happen on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Tuesday of the month in central Brighton and we also run an annual conference, usually in November.

## Who is UX Brighton aimed at?

You don't need to be a "UX designer" to attend UX Brighton. We aim our events at designers, developers, project managers, entrepreneurs, copywriters and basically anyone who thinks that listening to users makes them better at their job.

## Team

Founder & Curator, Danny Hope

Event Manager, Annie-Marie Page

### Advocates and volunteers

Luke Hay

## History

2008 â€“ Danny spoke at [BarCamp Brighton 2](http://barcamp.org/w/page/400551/BarCampBrighton2). The idea of founding a group was discussed. Jenny made a page for the idea. The next day we had loads of signups. Our innagural event was on 15 April 2008.

## Curate an event

Got an idea for a UX Brighton event you'd like to see?

We'd love it if you wanted to curate an evening and put some speakers together! We have done this loads of times and can help you at every step.

We have a checklist to guide you through finding speakers, promoting the evening and running it on the night. We have a number of venues that we regularly use and can book for you. Drop us a line, join our Slack or send us a tweet and we'll get you started.
