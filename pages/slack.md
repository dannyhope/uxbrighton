## Join the UX Brighton Slack

Add your email address here <https://slofile.com/slack/uxbri>

## Use Slack to

* `#introduce` yourself to the community
* discuss UX in `#general`
* `#ask` questions and seek help on UX work issues
* digest and get notified about `#events`
* find out about `#jobs`
* get advice about your `#portfolio`
* offer, request or discuss `#mentorship`
* post `#ads` about your UX tools and services
* tell `#admin` if someone’s breaking the rules

## Jobs

There’s a `#jobs` channel

* Don’t advertise jobs which Brightonians could not reasonably be expected to want or where living in Brighton would count against the applicant.
* You can post about any kind of role but only if it involves a user cenrted approach. For example a developer role would be allowed if it entails direct involvement in user research.
* Don’t advertise jobs outside of the `#jobs` channel.

To get more and better responses, include

* a job description
* salary/day rate
* the company name
* location/remote
* whether it’s full time, permanent or freelance

## Spam

* Don’t pester individuals.
* Don’t advertise your company’s wares outside the `#ads` channel unless it’s related to a conversation someone else has started.
