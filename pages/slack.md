## How to join the UX Brighton Slack group

1. **[Add your email address](https://slofile.com/slack/uxbri)**
2. **Introduce yourself**\
   Please tell us a bit about yourself (in the #introduce channel).\
   We ask that you do this before posting to other channels.

## Things you can do (once you’ve introduced yourself)

* discuss UX in the #general channel
* ask questions and seek help on UX work issues in the #ask channel
* discuss and get notified about #events
* find out about #jobs
* get advice about your #portfolio
* offer, request or discuss #mentorship
* post #ads about your UX tools and services
* tell #admin if someone’s breaking the rules

## Things you can’t do (even if you have introduced yourself)

Please don’t

* directly message people who don’t know you
* advertise your company’s wares outside the `#ads` channel unless it’s related to a conversation someone else has started

## Job ad rules

* Don’t advertise jobs which Brightonians could not reasonably be expected to want or where living in Brighton would count against the applicant.
* You can post about any kind of role as long as it’s user-centred. For example a developer role would be allowed if it entails direct involvement in user research.
* Don’t advertise jobs outside of the `#jobs` channel.

### Tips to get more and better responses

Include

* a job description
* salary/day rate
* the company name
* location/remote
* whether it’s full time, permanent or freelance

## Admin

If someone’s hassling you, drop a message in the #admin channel or, if you’d prefer, send a direct message to Danny Hope.

There are few other people who help with admin tasks. If you’d like to join this little team, send a direct message to Danny Hope in Slack.

### Admin tasks

There’s a (currently private) list of [Slack admin tasks in Notion](https://www.notion.so/uxbri/Moderate-Slack-edfa058b908a4b3c95af4bff2ac32da3).
