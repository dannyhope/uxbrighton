## Join the UX Brighton Slack group

1. **[Add your email address](https://slofile.com/slack/uxbri)**
2. **Introduce yourself**\
   Please tell us a bit about yourself (in the #introduce channel).\
   We ask that you do this before posting to other channels.

## Channels

* discuss UX in the **\#general** channel
* ask questions and seek help on UX work issues in the **\#ask** channel
* discuss and get notified about **\#events**
* discover **\#jobs**
* get advice about your **\#portfolio**
* offer, request or discuss **\#mentorship**
* post **\#ads** about your UX tools and services
* tell **\#admin** if someone’s breaking the rules

## Things you can’t do (even if you have introduced yourself)

* Don’t directly message people who don’t know you
* Don’t advertise your company’s wares outside the `#ads` channel unless it’s related to a conversation someone else has started

## Job ad dos and don’ts

Do

* post about any kind of role as long as it’s user-centered. For example a developer role would be allowed if it entails direct involvement in user research.
* (for a better response rate) include a job description, salary/day rate, the company name, location/remote, whether it’s full time, permanent or freelance

Don’t

* promote vacancies where living in Brighton would count against applicants
* advertise jobs outside of the `#jobs` channel

## Get help

If someone’s hassling you, drop a message in the #admin channel or, if you’d prefer, send a direct message to Danny Hope in Slack.

## Admin team

Besides Danny, there are few other people who help with admin tasks. If you’d like to join this little team, send a direct message to Danny Hope in Slack.

If you’re one of the admin team trying to get to find it, here’s the [Slack admin guidance in Notion](https://www.notion.so/uxbri/Moderate-Slack-edfa058b908a4b3c95af4bff2ac32da3).
