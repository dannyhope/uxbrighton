## Visa

If you’re interested in attending a UX Brighton event and need a visa to travel to the UK, we are happy to provide you with a letter to the embassy to facilitate your visa process. Email your request to anniemarie@uxbri.org. 

## Tax

Sorry, you have to pay VAT on tickets as the event is taking place in the UK.
