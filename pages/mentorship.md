U﻿X Brighton’s mentorship programme supports UXers at each stage of their career. From student to Head of Design and anything in between. Whether you're a Researcher or Designer we pair mentors and mentees to help you grow your UX career. 

## A﻿bout the programme

T﻿he mentorship programme is a 9 month scheme designed to support your career growth within the UX community. Whether you're a mentor, mentee or peer mentor it's an opportunity to eradicate impostor syndrome, develop your professional relationships, improve your skills, increase confidence and achieve your career goals. 

U﻿X design consultancy, [cxpartners](https://www.cxpartners.co.uk/) are this year's programme sponsor.

Want to become a mentor? Please email [anniemarie@uxbri.org](anniemarie@uxbri.org). 

## C﻿ommitment

We ask that you commit to meeting with your mentee or mentor at least 1-hour a month until the end of the programme in April 2023. You can meet virtually or face-to-face. We recommend that mentees set a goal to work towards within the programme, mentors can support mentees to achieve this goal by helping them make a plan, be accountable and asking guiding questions. When considering mentoring it's useful to know the [C's of Great UX Mentorship](https://youtu.be/0tZomurxE0w).
