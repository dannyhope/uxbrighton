        <h2 class="h1 mt5">About UX Brighton</h2>
        <p class="standfirst">Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks around a single theme.</p>

        <p>Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.</p>



        <!-- <p><strong>This year’s theme is Advancing Research</strong>. We'll be taking a deep dive into research — looking beyond traditional methods to tackle everything from how research can inform strategy to building research teams; from designing surveys that don't suck, to researching for new technologies.</p> -->
