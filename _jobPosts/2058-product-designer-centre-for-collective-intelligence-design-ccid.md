<h2>Overview</h2><p>Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence helps create new ways for communities to use technology to harness their insights, ideas and power to act on the problems that matter to them and create the futures they want. We know well-designed systems can help promote healthy collective action at scale, but too often technology is designed to solve the needs of individuals or large organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mission is to design digital tools and products that allow communities to respond collectively to challenges, and that help public and voluntary sector institutions strengthen trust and collaboration with citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We help our partners to understand where and how collective intelligence approaches can help address the problems they’re working on. We apply collective intelligence design - which brings together insights from diverse groups of people, with new sources of data (such as sensor or mobile phone data) and digital technologies (including AI) - to develop bespoke solutions to those problems. We use rigorous research methods to test, learn and evaluate each solution.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Role</h2><p>Nesta is looking for an ambitious mid level product designer with real world experience to contribute to the design and prototyping of new digital ‘collective intelligence’ solutions. At the heart of CI design is the ability to effectively combine insights and actions of large crowds, data and digital technologies to tackle complex social challenges. This is a unique opportunity to apply, shape and develop expertise in an emerging area of innovation practice, working with our partners and clients all over the world in a social-purpose enterprise. As part of an interdisciplinary team, you’ll work with the Centre’s software developers, researchers and product managers to create high impact digital solutions, tools and and services to help tackle climate change, improve health and increase civic and democratic participation.
