<h2>About the Borough &nbsp;</h2><p>Joining us, you get to work for not just one high performing London Borough, but two.</p><p>Kingston and Sutton councils have a number of shared services serving both authorities, with some teams and roles more focussed on one council than the other, but the majority are shared across both, meaning you get multiple opportunities to learn from a wider pool of activities and two different political bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>We work flexibly in both Kingston and Sutton offices, and support working at home or flexible working patterns that enable you to tailor your working and personal life.
