<p>We’d all like amazing work to do, and real work-life balance. That’s waiting for you at Sainsbury’s. Think about the scale it takes for us to feed the nation. The level of data, transactions and variety it involves. Then you’ll realise that ours is a modern software engineering environment because it has to be. We’ve made serious investment into a Tech Academy and into setting standards and principles. We iterate, learn, experiment and push ways of working such as Agile, Scrum and XP. So you can look forward to awesome opportunities in everything from AI to reusable tech.&nbsp;</p><p>At Sainsbury’s we believe that the customer should be at the heart of everything we do.&nbsp;Our vision is to create the easiest, most enjoyable experiences that better serve our customers’ ever-changing needs. We work across a range of services, products, touch points and tools to deliver distinctive, integrated, and consistent experiences for our customers and colleagues across Sainsbury’s Group (which includes Sainsbury’s Food, Argos, Tu, Habitat, Nectar, and Smart Charge).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We drive brilliant experiences across all our brands in-store and online, operating in agile teams and squads, working seamlessly with teams right across the business to make the most of the exceptional knowledge, insight and talent we have.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that great experiences aren't created by accident. That's why we've built a large, diverse and inclusive team. It may be surprising but there are 80 of us. From UX to service designers. Copywriters to researchers and accessibility specialists. Together, we craft exceptional products and services across all our brands and channels. We make things better, and we're respected across the group for the impact we have.</p><h2>The role</h2><p>You'll be working on Sainsbury’s digital and technology products within our <strong>in-store design team</strong>. We look after the experience of digital products and devices for customers and colleagues in our 1,400 stores. This is a broad and varied portfolio of products at the intersection of digital in physical environments and uses the latest innovation in technology to make shopping and working notably easier for customers and colleagues.</p><p>This role will be focussed on&nbsp;achieving the best experience for all our colleagues using websites and apps related to People (HR). That’s everything from recruitment and onboarding, to selecting shifts and learning new skills, as well as colleague discounts and internal communication. You’ll have opportunities to design new features, whole apps or websites, and think end-to-end about how they fit in the wider digital ecosystem to best suit a colleague’s workflow.</p><p>In your product team, you'll lead the research, design and testing of innovative ideas. You'll visit our stores to meet our customers and colleagues. You'll observe and interview them to experience what they do first-hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Your aim will be to understand them and the problems they face. This is challenging because the problems are complex and solving a problem could have a knock-on effect elsewhere. That's why you'll learn the wider context of how our stores and business works. You'll do this working with people from across the group, who will all have different knowledge, perspectives, and opinions.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes you make will affect hundreds of thousands of colleagues in one of the UK's largest retailers.&nbsp;</p><h2>What you'll do</h2><ul><li><p>Research colleague needs through observation and interviews&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Organise and conduct in-store and remote research&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Interact with stakeholders from across the group to share insights and ideas&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Design and test concepts and solutions&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with diverse teams from different disciplines&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Champion inclusive design principles in your work and throughout the team&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Work within agile teams to get your solutions into the hands of our customers&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What we're looking for</h2><p>Industry experience as a UX or Product Designer is essential. As are the core technical skills outlined in the role details above. Alongside this, we're looking for certain behaviours and competency skills. These skills will help you thrive in a dynamic team like ours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Skills we're looking for</h2><ul><li><p>User centred design and knowledge of how to design inclusively&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Competency and capability at UX design process, collaboration, and co-creation</p></li><li><p>Ability to do visual and interaction design using a design system&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Expertise designing and prototyping with tools such as Figma&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Capable of conducting research and interpreting results&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Influence and negotiation skills&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Adaptable to changing priorities, complexity and unknowns&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Stakeholder engagement, management, and confidence challenging your peers and stakeholders&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Taking the initiative and driving change&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Tailoring your approach for different audiences&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Strategic mindedness – thinking of the broader picture and connecting dots.</p></li></ul><h2>Support we will provide</h2><ul><li><p>A thriving design culture, opportunity to discuss and share work with open, collaborative feedback</p></li><li><p>A mature design system and set of standards to work with&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Research, accessibility and UX copywriting expertise</p></li></ul><p>Tips and guidance on what we look for in portfolios:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://medium.com/p/1ace9c422d2">https://medium.com/p/1ace9c422d2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We are committed to being a truly inclusive retailer, so you’ll be welcomed whoever you are and wherever you work. Around here, there’s always the chance to try something new&nbsp;-&nbsp;whether that’s as part of an evolving team or somewhere else across the business - and we take development seriously and promise to support you.

Here are some of them:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Starting off with colleague discount, you'll be able to get 10% off at Sainsbury's, Argos, TU and Habitat after 4 weeks. This increases to 15% off at Sainsbury’s every Friday and Saturday and 15% off at Argos every pay day. We've also got you covered for your future with our pensions scheme and life cover. You'll also be able to share in our success as you may be eligible for a performance-related bonus of up to 10% of salary, depending on how we perform. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Your wellbeing is important to us too. You'll receive an annual holiday allowance, and you can buy additional holiday. We also offer other benefits that will help your money go further such as season ticket loans, cycle to work scheme, health cash plans, pay advance (where you can access some of your pay before pay day) as well access to a great range of discounts from hundreds of other retailers.
