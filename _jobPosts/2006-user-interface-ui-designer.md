<h2>About JustPark</h2><p>JustPark, established in 2006, is the UKâ€™s favourite parking app, parking a car every 2 seconds and processing Â£100m+ of parking income for our partners each year. With 13 million drivers and more than 250,000 spaces, weâ€™re proud to work with some of the UKâ€™s biggest Local Authorities, hotel chains and car park operators. JustPark markets and monetises both unused residential driveways and under-utilised car park capacity, benefiting drivers and creating revenue for space owners.&nbsp;</p><p>Uniquely in the industry, we focus on both the driver and the operator experience to make parking better for all stakeholders. In addition to working with traditional parking real-estate,&nbsp; we also work with 10,000s of independent landlords and small businesses. We pride ourselves in our ability to provide exceptional service, a smooth onboarding process and being on the cutting edge of innovation.&nbsp;</p><h2>About ParkHub</h2><p>Founded in 2010, ParkHub is the USâ€™s leading event parking technology provider powering the largest venues and stadiums. This includes over 70% of pro-sports teams and managing over $3bn in revenue on their platform. ParkHub is optimising the worldâ€™s journeys by providing cutting-edge enterprise technology to support&nbsp; the global parking industry. The companyâ€™s products offer contactless payment options, real-time&nbsp; operational data, robust performance analytics, and leading integrations with ticketing and parking reservation providers.</p><h2>Our merged organisation</h2><p>Following the merger in April 2024, JustPark and ParkHub now form one of the largest parking organisations globally, serving over 20 million drivers and more than 500 B2B customers, with a combined booking volume exceeding $1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas before, JustPark was purely an expert in consumer parking reservations and on-demand payments, as a combined business we are now also market leaders in providing best-in-class venue and event parking management services and business intelligence.
