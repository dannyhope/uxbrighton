<h2>About Griffin</h2><p>Hi, we’re Griffin! We’re the bank for companies who want to build and launch financial products.</p><h3>Our context</h3><p>We're rapidly heading towards a future where most of us access financial services through technology companies rather than high street banks. All sorts of companies are now embedding financial products into their apps and user journeys so that their customers can seamlessly make payments, manage expenses, take out loans, save, invest, and do more.</p><p>The problem is that companies are still dependent on legacy banking infrastructure if they want to offer regulated financial products. They need to either partner directly with an (slow-moving, risk-averse) incumbent bank and/or stitch together middleware from various Banking as a Service (BaaS) providers. This process is slow, expensive, and complex and makes it very hard for companies to get new financial products off the ground.</p><p>At Griffin, we want to change this.</p><h3>Our purpose</h3><p>We want to make it easy for companies to bring finance to their customers at the point of greatest relevance. So, we built a bank.</p><p>But not just any bank! Griffin is a technology platform <em>and</em> a bank: fully regulated, API-first, developer-centric, and purpose-built to serve innovative fintechs and brands who want to build and embed financial products.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://griffin.com/about">Learn more about what we do.</a></p><h3>Our culture</h3><p>Our culture is our most important asset, and one of the ways we safeguard it is by being extremely intentional about hiring the right people. We won't hire people who don’t seem like a strong fit for our core values, even if they're otherwise extremely qualified.</p><p>We also believe that smart, motivated, conscientious people thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. That’s why we’re transparent by default, and we encourage open discussion and challenge across all levels of the organisation. We’re also remote-first, asynchronous, and fully flexible - because you're the expert on how and when you do your best work.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://griffin.com/culture">Learn more about our culture.</a></p><h3>The Design team</h3><p>We’re a small team of designers and engineers specialising in product, brand and content. We’re designing for a future of programmable finance. The space is inherently complex and the bar for solutions is high, which creates opportunities for design to have an outsized impact on our customers’ success.</p><p>We care deeply about creating an exceptional end-to-end user experience, and delivering this at scale. We work from first principles and in close collaboration with other teams. We prioritise thoughtful problem-solving over shipping at breakneck speed.
