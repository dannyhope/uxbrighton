<h2 id="the-opportunity">The opportunity</h2>
<p>Are you an experienced UX Designer? Do you have a strong technical skill set, able to create exceptional digital customer experiences that deliver value and impact quickly?</p>
<p>We're looking for an experienced UX Designer to join our dynamic team and help embed user insight and user centric thinking across the business, ensuring we offer an outstanding digital experience for our users.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-role">About the role</h2>
<p>As a UX Designer, you’ll work in the team responsible for leading the digital design and user experience for the British Heart Foundation. The role involves working on our digital customer experiences delivering inspirational design ideas, intuitive UX expertise and best practice – whilst staying abreast of new themes in digital design and customer experience engagement trends.</p>
<p>The British Heart Foundation (BHF) is driving digital change to deliver more personalised customer journeys and experiences for our supporters and donors. And in turn help grow fundraising income and provide health information and support to the 7.6m people living with heart and circulatory conditions in the UK.</p>
<p>The Digital team is responsible for strategically developing, delivering, and optimising digital experiences for BHF customers.</p>
<h2 id="working-arrangements">Working arrangements</h2>
<p>This is a blended role, where your work will be dual located between your home and our London office.</p>
<p>At the BHF we believe in the power of being together, so our colleagues on blended contracts can expect to spend some time in their office, at least one day each week, on average.  The use of our office spaces is driven in part by your role and the activities you need to do. This may vary from time to time, so you will need to work in a flexible way to unlock your best work for our cause.</p>
<p>Need more help balancing your work and home life? Talk to us about what flexibility is available at the application or interview stage. </p>
<h2 id="about-you">About you</h2>
<p>With an outstanding portfolio and deep knowledge of design principles and methods, you’ll be a bold and brilliant UX designer with strong expertise delivering conversion focused products and content offers to market, that serve and delight customers across mobile and web.</p>
<p>Delivering the best customer experience through a design thinking process is your passion and you’ll be able to bring all stakeholders on the continuous improvement journey.</p>
<p>You’ll be a strategic problem solver with the ability to intuitively understand a wide range of audiences and customer needs and build lasting relationships across the organisation.</p>
<p>With solid knowledge of responsive web design, UX for accessibility and inclusion, and a track record of staying ahead of UX trends, you bring good experience of creating wireframes and digital prototypes (ideally with experience in platforms such as Figma, Adobe XD or similar)</p>
<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
<p>Our people are at the heart of everything we do. By funding research across six decades, we’ve helped keep millions of hearts beating and millions of families together. We’re investing in ground-breaking research that will get us closer than ever to a world free from the fear of heart and circulatory diseases.</p>
