We’ve moved away from short-term financial success to really focus on delighting and retaining users on both sides of our marketplace, which opens the door to so many ideas I can’t wait to see become a reality. There are some fundamental things we’re aiming to change to really take this product and business to the next level, and really become the “go-to” place to buy and sell services.</em></p><p><strong>Asher, Head of Design</strong><em> - “Bark is really focused on delivering value for its users. This is echoed throughout the company orgs; from Customer Success, Insights, through to Product, Design, and Engineering. There is a lot of freedom to think outside the box to deliver new or improved solutions for very customer-focused problems. Our users are the core of our business and every collaboration, idea, and metric is focused on providing them that great experience.”</em></p><p><strong>Tom, Lead Product Designer</strong> - <em>“Product has changed a lot since I started, and has been instrumental in steering the company into thinking about its users (critical from a design perspective!) Product and design work very closely at Bark – highly collaborative with daily interaction about ongoing work, from discovery through to implementation. There's a lot of exciting things happening at Bark at the moment, and feel we're genuinely on the verge of creating a powerful product that will have genuine impact in helping businesses win work across the world.”</em></p><p><strong>George, Lead Engineer</strong><em> - “Working so closely with the product and design teams gives me an opportunity to get involved in the product from the earliest stage. Each week we build a new experiment which is a true collaboration of the ideas from everyone in the group. Due to the scale of Bark as a business, it’s also hugely rewarding to see that the work we produce can make a massive impact, by generating millions of pounds in annualised revenue.”</em></p><h2>Some of our benefits</h2><ul><li><p>Share options in a rapidly growing company whose founders have a proven track record and are Private Equity backed</p></li><li><p>Flexible hybrid working policy with a central office in London</p></li><li><p>Private health insurance (Aviva) including dental and vision coverage</p></li><li><p>Personal yearly L&amp;D Budgets with £1,000 to spend on your development</p></li><li><p>Enhanced <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://gympass.com/en-uk">Gympass</a> membership for all employees with access to a wide-range of gyms, mental health resources, and fitness classes</p></li><li><p>Fully stocked kitchen, snacks, and weekly team lunches</p></li><li><p>Cycle to work scheme</p></li><li><p>Regular wellness weeks with industry leading talks through to massages in the office</p></li><li><p>Being at the forefront of an industry with new and exciting problems to solve</p></li></ul><h2>Perks and Benefits</h2><ul><li><p>Share options in a rapidly growing company whose founders have a proven track record and are Private Equity backed</p></li><li><p>Flexible working policy with a central office in London</p></li><li><p>Private health insurance run by Aviva including dental cover</p></li><li><p>Personal annual L&amp;D Budgets with £1,000 to spend on your development</p></li><li><p>Enhanced Gympass membership for all employees with access to mental health courses and fitness classes</p></li><li><p>Fully stocked kitchen and monthly&nbsp;lunches</p></li><li><p>Financial advisor</p></li><li><p>Cycle to work scheme<br></p></li><li><p>Regular wellness weeks with industry leading talks through to massages in the office</p></li><li><p>Being at the forefront of an industry with new and exciting problems to solve</p></li></ul><h2>Diversity Statement</h2><p>At Bark, we are a platform for people, revolutionising the way professionals and individuals connect since 2014.
