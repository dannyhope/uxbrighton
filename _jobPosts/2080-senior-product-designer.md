Boyes-Smith</h2><p><em>“Design is in its infancy at hx, and the potential for impact is enormous—not only through our ability to create and inspire but also through our power to advocate for an experience-first approach to building great products. I left my role as Head of Design at Miro to join hx as the founding designer, tasked with building the design function from scratch. It was a big move, but what gave me confidence was the energy and excitement from my product and engineering partners for design and the incredible opportunities ahead.</em></p><p><em>Now, I’m looking for talented designers to join me as we pool our collective knowledge and experience to build our dream design team. At hx, we focus on </em><strong><em>getting things done</em></strong><em>. We value </em><strong><em>collaboration over bureaucracy</em></strong><em>, and we keep processes light to give ourselves the freedom to </em><strong><em>create and deliver quickly</em></strong><em>. It’s about maintaining an environment where everyone can take ownership, act decisively, and </em><strong><em>make real impact</em></strong><em> without getting bogged down.</em></p><p><em>Cards on the table—you would be joining a nimble design team, where we all support each other and wear many hats. If you’ve been searching for a hands-on, dynamic role with </em><strong><em>growth opportunities</em></strong><em>, where you can flex your creative muscles and make meaningful contributions, this could be the challenge you’ve been waiting for… Let’s talk.”</em></p>
