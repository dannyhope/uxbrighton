<h2 id="what-is-veedio">What is <a href="http://veed.io/">VEED.IO</a>?</h2>
<p> At <a href="https://www.veed.io/">VEED</a>, our mission is to make video creation accessible to anyone.</p>
<p>No hard-to-use equipment, painful learning curve, or keeping track of multiple subscriptions to take your ideas from record ‚Üí share. With VEED, you can do this with a single tool.</p>
<p>In just a few years, we‚Äôve gone from one user to millions. From no revenue to $15M+ ARR. From bootstrapped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/veed-an-online-video-editing-platform-picks-up-35m-from-sequoia/">backed by Sequoia</a>, one of the biggest VC firms in the world. From a team of two to a team of 170+. And we‚Äôre seeking more talented, motivated and entrepreneurial individuals to join our growing team.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-team">About the team</h2>
<p>Product Growth is a multi-disciplinary team focusing on the growth user journey from activation to monetisation. The group works autonomously with a culture of <em>‚Äúa startup within a startup‚Äù</em>. The Engagement team is an essential part of the overall Growth team. As a new team, there are great opportunities to help shape the direction and contribute to the strategy.</p>
<p>We love interacting with our users and solving ways to move them from casual users to core users, increasing the amount of features the users use within the product, increasing frequency and number of videos exported.</p>
<p>Engaging your users is crucial to building a great product. Almost everything we do is deeply influenced by our discussions with customers, from our recently launched screen recorder product to eye contact correction. </p>
<h2 id="about-the-role">About the role</h2>

We‚Äôre looking for someone who can strategically contribute to our product development end-to-end and improve existing features.</p>
<p>In this role, you‚Äôll be responsible for ensuring users return to the product, understand the value of the product and the features and continue to use more and more features.</p>
<p>Product design for us means a wide range of skill sets such as user research, testing, visual design, UX design, IA, prototyping, understanding data, and most importantly, user empathy.</p>
<p>You are focusing on users needs, and goals, while working towards the business objectives and striving to make the company successful.</p>
