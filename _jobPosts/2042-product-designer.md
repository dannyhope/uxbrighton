<p>At GWI we’re always looking for <strong>extraordinary people</strong> who thrive on making an extraordinary impact. Right now we’re looking for a<strong>&nbsp;Product Designer</strong>&nbsp;to play a key role in our <strong>product team in London. </strong>If that’s you, and making a difference gets you out of bed in the morning, keep reading. It could be the start of something, well, extraordinary.</p><h2>Sounds great, what will I be doing? 🤔</h2><p>As our <strong>product designer</strong> your&nbsp;primary focus will be to create functional UX and UI design for our product. We have designers assigned to different squads looking after areas such as account management, nurture journey and data analysis tools. You’ll produce multiple different approaches informed by user needs, business objectives, and technical capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Typical projects include discovery, UX research, end-to-end flows, sketches, wireframes, user testing, prototyping, visual design and QA. Through UX research and data analysis, you’ll understand our user’s needs, tasks, and goals and translate them into creative and functional experiences. You will evolve concepts to the relevant level of fidelity, from prototypes to final mock-ups. You will be working in Agile and collaborating with the Product Managers and Engineering Leads in your squad.</p><p>It’s also fun; shaking things up is what working for a growing company is all about. So you’ll need to be flexible, comfortable with continuous change, and working in a high-tempo environment as we grow.</p><h2>What do I need to bring with me? 🧳</h2><p>You’ll need to be able to demonstrate the core skills this role requires. You don't have to tick <em>all</em> the boxes right away; the important thing is that you’re willing to learn. Here’s what the team will be looking for:</p><ul><li><p>👉 Solid understanding in UX and UI, user-centred design principles, interaction design and responsive design.</p></li><li><p>👉 You will have a great understanding of usability and accessibility best practices.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>👉 You will need a proven track record in producing successful user experience design for large sites or SaaS platforms.</p></li><li><p>👉 You have a passion for understanding user needs, using the insights to incrementally deliver value for our users.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Equally important is attitude. We want people who <strong>think big</strong> (to make an impact), <strong>ask why </strong>(to find a better way), and <strong>show respect</strong> (to everyone, at every level, all the time). Those are our values, exemplified by our leadership team, and they’re a big part of what we’re looking for in you.</p><h2>Interview steps 👟</h2><ul><li><p><strong>👉 Preliminary phone call</strong> with the Talent Team<strong> </strong>(no video required)</p></li><li><p><strong>👉 First video interview</strong> with the hiring managers&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>👉 Second (and final*) video interview&nbsp;</strong>with the hiring panel, often including a presentation, followed by a<strong> values conversation </strong>with members of the wider GWI community.</p></li></ul><p>*Don’t be alarmed if there are other stages in the process, it’s all part of the plan for some of our roles.</p><h2>What exactly is GWI? 👀</h2><p>GWI is modernized consumer research; global, on-demand, and accessible to everyone, not just data experts. Our platform is designed for companies looking for fresh and insightful data about their consumers’ values, purchase journeys, media usage, and social media habits.&nbsp;</p><p>With data representing the views of nearly 3 billion people across 52+ countries, GWI has become the go-to for agencies, brands, and media companies that want to know what really drives their audience to action.</p><p><strong>Since launching in 2009 we’ve grown at a healthy pace, and to maintain this growth we need more extraordinary people. Hence this ad. Hence you.</strong></p><h2>What’s in it for me? 🎁</h2><p>You’ll do the sort of work that got you excited about your career in the first place - not as a cog in a machine, but as an individual whose contribution matters. So <strong>gigantic job satisfaction </strong>comes as standard, but it’s only part of the package. You’ll also get:</p><ul><li><p><strong>🌴 Tons of days off: </strong>25 days annual leave | Xmas office closures&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>💸 More than a great salary: </strong>Employee share scheme | Health cash plan | 4% pension plan matching&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>🧘 Great work-life balance</strong>: Flexitime | early Friday finishes | Work-from-anywhere options</p></li><li><p><strong>🏡 Family-focused flexibility: </strong>Carer days | Enhanced parental leave | Health cash plan for your family</p></li><li><p><strong>💪 A commitment to YOU: </strong>Accredited learning programs | A commitment to mental and physical health | Reward and recognition programs | Career development opportunities</p></li><li><p><strong>🌎 A commitment to the community:</strong> DE&amp;I committee | Volunteer options | 100% donation matching | Payroll giving options</p></li></ul><p>Put all that together and GWI is the friendliest, most fulfilling place any of us has ever worked.</p><h2>Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion</h2><p>We take DE&amp;I seriously. Not only is it obviously the right thing to do, it’s also the bedrock of our value of<strong> show respect</strong> and at the heart of our company culture.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re a global data business, so it’s essential our data reflects the global reality. Putting diversity into practice like this literally makes our business stronger.&nbsp;<strong>That’s why we strive to make our offices - and our teams - as diverse as our data. </strong>Want to know more?
