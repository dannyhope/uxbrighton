<h2>About Us</h2><p>Since 2016, Patchwork Health has been on a mission to make truly flexible and sustainable working a reality for all healthcare staff. Their fully integrated workforce management solution helps optimise outcomes for organisations, managers, staff and patients alike. Built by a team of dedicated healthcare veterans, and co-created with the NHS, their technology and services have been embraced by over 100 healthcare sites to date.&nbsp;<br><br>Patchwork offers a range of different solutions, including temporary staff banks, which enable organisations to source temporary staff from their own pool of approved workers; ‘collaborative staff banks’, which help healthcare organisations team up with others in the same region to widen and share their temporary staffing pools; an innovative new rostering solution which enables more flexible, sustainable staffing for permanent healthcare staff; and an Agency Manager which makes it easier for managers to select appropriate temporary staff from external agencies when necessary. Patchwork Insights also provides managers with comprehensive data oversight, to monitor staffing trends, shift fill rates and pay rate escalations, and reliably plan ahead to prevent staffing gaps.&nbsp;<br><br>Patchwork Health has been recognised as HSJ’s 2022 Staffing Solution of the Year, and have recently received the prestigious HSJ Partnership Award and the Spectator’s Economic Innovator of the Year Award.</p><h2><strong>The Role</strong></h2><p>Patchwork’s Product Design Team is responsible for taking complex and often manual industry processes and translating them into intuitive, smart and usable experiences across our product suite.<br><br>We are looking for&nbsp;a proven problem solver who can elevate the user experience of our mobile apps to be the benchmark for HealthTech products, which others aim to emulate.
