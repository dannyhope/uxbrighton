We’re on a mission to reimagine and elevate pasta as a category, which is worth a staggering £3.8bn yet has seen little innovation for decades.</p><p>Since launching our original fresh pasta recipe kit service in 2016, we have built a cult following of British pasta lovers – our Evangelists – who are passionate about discovering the breadth and variety of pasta, as well as the irresistible stories behind it.</p><p>Today, Pasta Evangelists is backed by Barilla (the world’s biggest pasta company) and is proud to be the UK’s biggest pasta brand by revenues, as well as one of the UK’s fastest-growing startups. In addition to our website, our recipe kits are also available for customers to purchase through major online retailers like Ocado &amp; Amazon Fresh. Londoners can also treat themselves to fine Italian dinings at our high-end Harrods Pasta Bar, or learn to make our signature dishes from scratch at our viral Pasta Academy, where we welcome thousands of pasta lovers every month.</p><p>Most recently, we’ve been busy disrupting Britain’s pizza-centric Italian takeaway market with a brand new fresh pasta takeaway concept, available on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://pastaevangelists.com">pastaevangelists.com</a> as well as major delivery players like Deliveroo, UberEats and JustEat. With more than 40 kitchens across the UK, we’re expanding coverage to new cities on an almost weekly basis (including our first openings in Scotland and Wales!). We've also opened the UK's biggest <em>pastificio </em>(which, in Italian, means pasta factory, but 'pastificio' better reflects the type of fresh, artisanal pasta we produce) in Acton, West London, allowing us to make ever more exciting and ambitious pasta and sauces for our customers. &nbsp;</p><p>Given our ambitions, we are looking for exceptional professionals to lead our business through its next growth chapter.</p>
