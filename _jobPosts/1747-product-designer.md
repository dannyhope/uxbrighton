<h2>About Us</h2><p>YouLend is a rapidly growing FinTech Company that is the preferred embedded financing platform for many of the world’s leading e-commerce sites, tech companies and payment services providers. Our software platform enables our partners to offer flexible financing products in their own branding to their merchant base without capital at risk.</p><p>We believe that the future of financial services will be delivered by customer-oriented tech companies that embed financing in their customer journeys, and we are building the solutions that will power that future.</p><p>Here at YouLend we believe that the future of financial services will be decentralised. We work with the likes of Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Shopify and Stripe to provide embedded financing solutions for their merchant customers, allowing them to grow their businesses with simple, flexible access to funding.</p><p>We have a number of ambitious goals for 2024 and beyond, to both improve our existing products and develop new ones. With this in mind, we’re looking for a Product Designer who can assist our Design Lead, utilising data, insights and customer research to deliver this ambition at pace and to a high standard.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>As the second designer in the team, you will have a great deal of responsibility for the projects you take on. We value collaboration very highly and all strive to help each other where we can, but you’ll need to be comfortable working autonomously and being proactive in your communication with your team and managers.</p><p>You’ll work closely with product managers, developers and subject matter experts in a number of teams, providing your insight on best practice in UX, interaction design and UI.</p><p>You’ll help to strengthen the design function alongside the Design Lead by contributing to research practices, helping to create new processes alongside our product team, and helping to build a new design system.</p><p>You’ll also work regularly with our Partnerships team, assisting them with assets that they use when pitching to new partners.</p><h3>Essential Skills</h3><ul><li><p>You have a minimum 2-3 years experience in product/UX design.</p></li><li><p>You've worked collaboratively with cross-functional product teams.</p></li><li><p>You've been responsible for shipping at least one product/feature/improvement, and been able to measure the results.</p></li><li><p>You’re highly proficient in Figma and know your way around its toolset to get work completed fast.</p></li></ul><h3>Desirable Skills</h3><h4>Design</h4><ul><li><p>You know how to design in full customer journeys or systems, not just individual screens.</p></li><li><p>You’re comfortable working across the full stack of product design, and are, at the very least, beginning to figure out an area of specialism.</p></li><li><p>You think instinctively about best practice in UX, interaction design and UI.</p></li><li><p>You understand that sometimes, the best design is no design at all.</p></li><li><p>You maintain pace - you know when enough is enough in terms of researching/ideating, and you’re confident to make the leap into creating a solution.</p></li><li><p>You can quickly iterate on a variety of concepts, and can turn one or more of them into a more polished version with minimal fuss.</p></li><li><p>You can create detailed flows or prototypes to illustrate specifics of a customer journey, especially edge cases.</p></li><li><p>You have a good idea of what success looks like for us, and know not only how to assess your work, but when and why.</p></li><li><p>You have worked with, and perhaps contributed to, a design system.</p></li></ul><h4>Working in a team</h4><ul><li><p>You are able to present your work confidently to relevant stakeholders, using good rationale to justify your decisions.</p></li><li><p>You’ve attended (or even led) at least a handful of cross-functional sessions/workshops before.</p></li><li><p>You strike a balance between working autonomously and collaboratively - you understand the benefits and drawbacks of both and know when to use each method of work to maximise your productivity.</p></li><li><p>You proactively share and discuss work often with your team, not only to receive but also to give feedback.</p></li><li><p>You understand the importance of gaining stakeholder buy-in and ‘bringing people along the journey’.</p></li><li><p>You are comfortable working with developers to handoff designs, and can answer their questions about expected behaviour. You accept challenges to your work from a technical perspective and can work collaboratively with them to find a solid compromise.</p></li><li><p>Prioritisation and time management come fairly easily to you, but you proactively seek clarification when needed.</p></li></ul><h4>Understanding users</h4><ul><li><p>You have a good understanding of our customer base - the types of merchants we work with, the reasons they come to us, how they interact with our products and what their pain points are.</p></li><li><p>You’ve participated in some research activities before, such as usability testing, concept testing, surveys or user interviews.</p></li><li><p>You’re happy to participate in and even lead research/discovery exercises here, in an effort to learn more about our customers alongside product managers, sales, customer support, transformations and tech teams.</p></li><li><p>You can work alongside product managers to gather, filter and analyse our internal data to back up design decisions.</p></li><li><p>You take time to understand and analyse our competitors - what do they do well, what do they lack, and where are the opportunities for us to succeed.</p></li><li><p>You’re starting to look beyond the scope of your immediate projects. You may be quite new to strategy, but you like to think holistically about our entire experience to address our most important business goals.</p></li></ul><h4>Personal</h4><ul><li><p>You’re a driven and inquisitive designer who is always striving to improve, learn and develop.</p></li><li><p>You have the confidence to ask questions or do your own research when you don’t know something, and the initiative to make informed assumptions where appropriate.</p></li><li><p>You look to your manager to help you develop, but you take an active hand in shaping your own career path.</p></li><li><p>You like to try new things and actively volunteer to participate in projects/initiatives, even just to observe.</p></li><li><p>You like to foster relationships with colleagues in other teams and find ways to make that happen, especially in a hybrid environment where face-to-face isn’t always possible.</p></li><li><p>You understand the importance of process, but can also be flexible and step outside of it when there is good rationale for doing so.</p></li><li><p>You are proactive in keeping your manager updated regularly, to inform them on progress and flag issues you may need help with.</p></li><li><p>You have a good level of self-awareness. We all make mistakes, it's an important part of learning, but you can figure out how you could have done better and what you will do differently next time.</p></li><li><p>You like to celebrate successes within the team and uplift others - even if it’s not a project you worked on.</p></li><li><p>While not required, it’d be great if you’ve worked in fintech before.</p></li></ul><h2>Benefits</h2><p>Why join YouLend?</p><p>At YouLend, we champion diversity and embrace equal opportunity employment practices.
