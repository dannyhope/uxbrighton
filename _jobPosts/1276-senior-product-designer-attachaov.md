<h2>Our Ways of Working</h2><p><em>We believe that we do our best work when we are together, but also appreciate that everyone works in different ways. That’s why we operate with three working models which look to define where and how our people work - Remote, Hybrid, Site/Office - based.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Although we believe the majority of our people will choose our hybrid working model (at least 2 days in the office each week), for some of our teams that don't require as much in-person connection and collaboration, we offer fully remote working (with paid travel to the Moonpig office up to 6 times per year).&nbsp; <strong>Remote roles are specified directly on our job adverts</strong></p><h2>Work with us</h2><p>At Moonpig Group our mission is to create moments that matter, with our vision to become the Ultimate Gifting Companion.
