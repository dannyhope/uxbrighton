<h2>Your Pride in London&nbsp;</h2><p>Join Pride in London as a volunteer and contribute to the success of the UK's largest Pride event!</p><p>At Pride in London, we have a renewed sense of purpose to shine a light on the ongoing challenges faced by the LGBT+ community, even in the midst of progress. Our organisation is driven by a dedicated group of volunteers who come from diverse backgrounds and share a passion for equality and diversity. Together, we strive to raise awareness about LGBT+ issues and advocate for the freedoms that will enable every individual in our community to live their lives on an equal footing.<br><br>With the help of approximately 150 volunteers who contribute year-round, we have established Pride in London as a world-class event. We are committed to ensuring that Pride represents the full spectrum of our community.<br><br>We actively encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds, with a particular focus on promoting diversity. We welcome and value applications from women, people of colour, and those from the trans and non-binary communities. We believe that a diverse volunteer team enriches our organisation and strengthens our ability to make a meaningful impact.</p><h2>The Role</h2><p>If you're a designer who lives and breathes user-centred design, then this could be the role for you.

Now that we've got a great foundation to build on, we're beginning to test and experiment with new ideas. We will be re-developing the website with new UI and features, where you will be directly involved in making the website even more accessible and inclusive. We want to create new products to help support our community year round, but we can't do that without input from design.</p><p>The Digital team is focused on understanding our user needs and behaviours so that we can build the right solutions to solve their problems. Whether that's a year round events platform or this very volunteer application site, we create and evolve it, making sure that it is beautiful, accessible and delightful to use.&nbsp;</p><h2>In this role you'll be</h2><ul><li><p>Supporting our insights team in UI/UX and usability research</p></li><li><p>Working closely with various departments to understand their user journey</p></li><li><p>Creating AA accessible designs and testing these with users</p></li><li><p>Working with our Tech team to solve design problems in efficient ways</p></li><li><p>Helping to evolve the Pride in London Digital brand</p></li></ul><h2>What you get out of it</h2><ul><li><p>Working with an amazing team to grow and improve your skill set</p></li><li><p>To experiment with new software and/or design methodologies</p></li><li><p>Peer review of your work from other designers to help you upskill and improve your workThe opportunity to evolve a design system for the second largest event in London</p></li><li><p>Develop skills working with other departments, managing and mentorship others, and working within a product team.</p></li></ul><h2>How much time we need</h2><p>Each week you'll usually spend between 4-8 hours on Pride work.
