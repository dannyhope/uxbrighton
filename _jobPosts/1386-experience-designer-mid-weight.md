<p>In Sainsbury’s Tech, we power the UK’s number 1 multi-channel, multi-brand retailer. Our Product and Experience Design teams are made up of inspired and multidiscipline individuals who are empowered to solve hard problems in ways our customers love and serve the needs of our business.</p><h2>Why join us?</h2><p>We know that great experiences aren't created by accident. That's why we've built a large, diverse and inclusive team. It may be surprising but there are 80 of us. From UX to service designers. Copywriters to researchers and accessibility specialists. Together, we craft exceptional products and services across all our brands and channels. We make things better, and we're respected across the group for the impact we have.</p><p>Did we mention that we're an award-winning team? At the Grocer Gold Awards 2021, we won E-commerce Initiative of the Year. Our work helped elderly, vulnerable and disabled customers through the pandemic. It gave them priority access to home delivery slots. We also won Technology Initiative of the Year.</p><h2>The role</h2><p>You'll be working on Sainsbury’s products within our customer in-store team, which are mostly focussed on checkouts, our biggest customer touchpoint in the organisation. We take 1.2 billion transactions from our customers each year, which gives you an idea of the scale and complexity of the space you’ll be working in.</p><p>You’ll get to work on things like our award-winning Smartshop app (Scan as you shop technology), Self-Checkouts, Pick and go (just-walk-out technology) and Argos Pay@browse (Argos self-checkout) and any other digital touchpoint in-store.</p><p>In your product team, you'll lead the research, design and testing of new ideas. You'll visit our stores to meet our customers and colleagues. You'll observe and interview them to experience what they do first-hand.</p><p>Your aim will be to understand them and the problems they face. This is challenging because the problems are complex and solving a problem could have a knock-on effect elsewhere. That's why you'll learn the wider context of how our stores and business works. You'll do this working with people from across the group, who will all have different knowledge, perspectives and opinions. The changes you make will impact millions of customers in one of the UK's largest retailers.</p><h2>What you'll do</h2><ul><li><p>Research customer needs through observation and interviews</p></li><li><p>Organise and conduct in-store and remote research</p></li><li><p>Interact with stakeholders from across the group to share insights and ideas</p></li><li><p>Design and test concepts and solutions</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with diverse teams from different disciplines</p></li><li><p>Champion inclusive design principles in your work and throughout the team</p></li><li><p>Work within agile teams to get your solutions in to the hands of our customers</p></li></ul><h2>What we're looking for</h2><p>Industry experience as a UX, Product or Service Designer is essential. As are the core technical skills outlined in the role details above. Alongside this, we're looking for certain behaviours and competency skills. These skills will help you thrive in a dynamic team like ours.</p><h2>Skills we're looking for</h2><ul><li><p>Knowledge of how to design inclusively</p></li><li><p>Expertise designing and prototyping with tools such as Figma</p></li><li><p>Capable of conducting research and interpreting results</p></li><li><p>Influence and negotiation skills</p></li><li><p>Adaptable to changing priorities, complexity and unknowns</p></li><li><p>Confidence challenging your peers and stakeholders</p></li><li><p>Taking the initiative and driving change</p></li><li><p>Tailoring your approach for different audiences</p></li></ul><p>Tips and guidance on what we look for in portfolios: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://medium.com/sainsburys-digital-experience/experience-design-portfolios-what-we-look-for-at-sainsburys-1ace9c422d2">https://medium.com/sainsburys-digital-experience/experience-design-portfolios-what-we-look-for-at-sainsburys-1ace9c422d2</a></p><p>&nbsp;Colleague discount across the multi-brands – Sainsbury’s, Argos and Habitat</p><ul><li><p>Holiday allowance</p></li><li><p>Hybrid working</p></li><li><p>Bonus scheme</p></li><li><p>Pension plan</p></li><li><p>Special offers on gym memberships, restaurants, holidays, retail vouchers and more</p></li></ul><p>Work-life balance is important to us, so we offer our colleagues as much flexibility as possible in line with the needs of their role. We trust them to decide how, where and when they work, combining remote and collaborative working with a flexible approach to hours, giving them plenty of time and space for life outside of work whilst delivering against our business goals.</p><p>&nbsp;Across our multi-brands, we’re proud to be an equal opportunities employer that champions a diverse and inclusive culture.
