<p>Powster is a Creative Studio based in London and Los Angeles and we are looking for a proactive Mid-weight UX/UI DIGITAL DESIGNER to join our friendly team based in Hackney Wick (Zone 2).</p>
<p>We specialise in creating world-class interactive digital experiences and marketing campaigns for major movie studios, broadcasters, music artists, brands and streamers. Our work ranges from high-concept websites and film edits / post production, to immersive AR experiences and cutting-edge interactive activations.</p>
<p>We believe anything is possible, and if we haven’t done it before, we’ll pull together, work it out and make it happen. Our work has won FWAs, Webbys, Clios and loads more but we don’t want to stop there - you can find out more on our <a href="http://www.powster.com/">website</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/powster/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/powster-creative">Behance</a>. </p>
<h2 id="job-summary">Job Summary</h2>
<p>You’ll be joining a small and friendly creative department of creative producers, designers, video editors and 3D artists, where you will sit between a junior / mid-weight designer and a senior designer (who currently works remotely but will be joining us in London) and report to the Creative Director. You’ll also work closely with creative developers to deliver beautiful and functional digital experiences.</p>
<p>On a day to day basis you can expect to be working on pitch decks, key visuals, UX/UI across a wide range of platforms like Twitch, WebAR (Niantic - 8th Wall), webGL, SparkAR, TikTok and mobile-first creative sites, as well internal marketing/promotional tasks as needed. If you’re looking to grow, upskill and refresh yourself for the future, Powster is the place for you.</p>
<p>To keep team culture of collaboration strong, this role requires you come into the office in Hackney Wick T/W/T to work together and is mandatory for this role.</p>
<h2 id="why-powster">Why Powster?</h2>
<p>This role offers a huge amount of opportunity for the right candidate as Powster is in a unique industry position. </p>
<p>We’re a genuine digital creative studio that innovates, meaning that every project is conceived, designed and developed in-house. Unlike most agencies, you won’t be working with external production partners but will be able to collaborate with our in-house production team at every step of the way to see your work come to life. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for exciting projects outside of predictable briefs that most agencies offer –FMCG, femcare etc. – you’ll be excited by our scope of work, which are mostly for A-List films and Music Industry artists with audiences that already know and love them!-  Attention to detail and premium, beautiful art direction is key for all of our projects.</p>
<p>Our diverse company culture is something we take pride in and management lead with progressive values. We’re proud of our open, compassionate and hard working culture and are looking for a candidate craving a modern workplace and whose values align. </p>
<p>We understand that not everyone has had the opportunity to work on new tech like augmented reality yet, so we keep an open mind when looking at portfolios. For us, it is always about the individual's attitude, work ethic and ultimately their potential and desire to grow. Whilst it is difficult to keep up to speed with the changes in technology, ultimately it’s important that you have an interest and desire to learn about popular platforms / games / technology. So if this is something you are passionate about and have the craft skills, but have just not had the opportunity yet, then you should still apply. </p>
<p>Ultimately the person we are looking for sees the potential and excitement in Powster and the industry as much as we do.. Why simply work on another brief kerning type when you could be working on world first innovation for the entertainment industry?</p>
