<h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2>
<p>Vanquis Banking Group has a rich history dating back to 1880. The company was founded in Bradford by Joshua Kelley Waddilove as The Provident Clothing and Supply Company to help people access finance and goods who couldn’t from traditional lenders.</p>
<p>Today, Vanquis Banking Group is a FTSE All Share company listed on the London Stock Exchange with around 1.6 million customers and plays the same role in people’s lives today, as it did when it was founded.</p>
<p>Vanquis Banking Group is a unified group made up of two brands: Vanquis (cards and loans) and Moneybarn (vehicle finance). While they offer different products and services, they share the common purpose and customer-centric values at the heart of our group. We understand our customers are real people with varied life experiences, so everything we do from our products to our customer experience is designed with this in mind.</p>

<li>Experience in utilising evidenced user needs to influence senior stakeholders, and acting as a persuasive advocate for those needs.</li>
<li>Experience with designing taxonomies, ontologies, information architecture, and content hierarchies.</li>
