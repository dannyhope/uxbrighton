<h2 id="remote-strategy">Remote Strategy</h2>
<p>Algolia’s workplace strategy, <strong>Hybrid Remote</strong>, is designed to harness the power of the opportunities that remote work offers both employees and the company, while also providing an engaging in-office experience for the times when an employee is in an office. Our workplace approach reflects the belief that an employee’s impact, contribution, and output are more important than their physical location.</p>
<p>The majority of employees will be able to choose if, and when, they come into an office on a regular basis. There will be times when our people are asked to come into an office for “moments that matter:” activities like critical planning meetings and team social gatherings.  Beyond those events, 80% of our workforce may choose the location from where they work in the country in which they were hired.</p>
<p>We have physical offices in San Francisco, NYC, Atlanta, Paris, London, Austin, Sydney and Bucharest. <a href="https://www.algolia.com/about/">https://www.algolia.com/about/</a></p>
