Getting good data is critical for the Bank of England to do its job. The governor and deputy governors of the Bank know this. That’s why they put their name to the program.</p></li><li><p>Because it’s exciting to innovate inside a 300 year old institution. We like to think and do things differently. And it’s exciting to bring new ideas and new ways of working to a place with so much history.</p></li><li><p>Because we are a diverse and inclusive bunch. Our work is all about bringing people together that come from different backgrounds and have different ideas. That ethos applies to our team and everything we do.</p></li><li><p>Because we support and empower each other. We have a lot to do! To do everything requires us to be the best we can be. That’s why we think it is important to invest in ourselves and each other. We believe everyone in our team has strengths which everyone else can learn from. And the data says this is more than just talk. In surveys, our division’s top scores are on ‘growth’ and ‘recognition and feedback’, with [80%] of people saying they would recommend their manager to others.</p></li></ul><p>#LI-DP1</p><h2>&nbsp;Our Approach to Inclusion</h2><p>The Bank values diversity, equity and inclusion.
