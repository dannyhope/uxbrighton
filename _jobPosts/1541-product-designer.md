<h2>Who we are and why we exist</h2><p>&nbsp;At Liberis – merchants matter most! We’ve been on a mission to provide small and medium businesses (SMEs) with accessible and responsive finance since 2007. SMEs account for most businesses worldwide and are critical contributors to job creation and global economic development. They represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide.&nbsp;Despite this, more than three quarters (77%) of SME businesses last year were unable to secure the traditional bank financing they desperately needed to grow and thrive. This has created a $5 trillion funding gap for SMEs globally.</p><p>That’s where Liberis steps in! To best help small businesses, Liberis has built the leading global embedded finance platform. Through this, Liberis provides partners with the technology and financial solutions necessary to offer personalised and accessible funding to their small business customers.</p><p>To date with ~20 global strategic partners and direct reach to more than 1 million small businesses, Liberis has provided $1 bn of funding in over 50,000 transactions, enabling more than 100,000 jobs to be created and saved. We are making a genuine difference to your local pub, hairdresser and online retailer!</p><p>We are in a very exciting period of growth, in the UK and internationally, with teams based in London, Nottingham, Stockholm, Atlanta and remotely. We are looking for talented and ambitious individuals to help us reshape business finance. How we work is as important to us as what we do – exemplified by our behaviours:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Merchants matter most</strong> – our success is tied to our merchants'&nbsp;success</p></li><li><p><strong>Act like time is running out </strong>– the fastest company in a growing market will win</p></li><li><p><strong>Own every outcome </strong>– the hardest problems we face&nbsp;are yet to be solved</p></li><li><p><strong>Communicate directly </strong>– we don’t have time to beat around the bush</p></li><li><p><strong>Prove it </strong>- every feature we build, decision we make and action we take,&nbsp;matters</p></li><li><p><strong>Empathy always</strong> - Liberis wins when every employee thrives&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>If our mission and behaviours resonate – get in touch!</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2>Design at Liberis</h2><p>Liberis believes in a world where funding is accessible and frictionless for small business. No more tedious documentation, hundred page business plans and endless back and forth required by traditional banks. Instead, imagine if finance was never further than just a couple of clicks away. With funds reaching you exactly when you need them, allowing you to focus on what matters most - your business.</p><p>Making this a reality? As Liberis designers, well that’s our business.</p><p>It could be yours too.
