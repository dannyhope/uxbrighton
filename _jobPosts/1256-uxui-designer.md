<p>AnyVan makes moving anything, anywhere easier, more affordable and greener for everyone.  With Over 8 million customers across the UK and Europe since our launch over a decade ago, we’re proud to be known as the largest, fastest growing tech company in the logistics industry.</p>
<p>Like many popular marketplaces, we’re asset light – i.e., we don’t own any vehicles or employ any drivers.  We work with our transport partners and use technology to disrupt the entire delivery and moving process and to optimise the most efficient journeys.</p>
<p>Sustainability is a core part of AnyVan’s mission and reducing environmental impact has always been at the heart of our business. We’re proud to say we’ve achieved carbon-neutral status on all our transport moves, and we won’t stop here.</p>
<p>We’ve continuously celebrated exciting growth and key milestones, a key highlight being a £125mn investment from Vitruvian partners to reinforce our position as the UK market leader.   We’re expecting the next 5 years to be even more exciting.</p>
<p>Our platform might be driven by technology, but we know it’s our people that make AnyVan a great place to work.  We think big, we think differently, and we empower our colleagues to make a difference. We know good ideas can come from anyone in any role – so if you’re a self-starter looking to ‘move’ your career forward – Team AnyVan would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>We have a unique opportunity for a tech-savvy digital product designer to join our growing product team working on both mobile and web product opportunities.  Joining a small design team you’ll need to be proactive, hands on and have a commercially-minded approach with an emphasis on driving engagement.</p>
<h2 id="what-youll-be-doing">What you'll be doing</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="skills-and-experience-we-think-youll-need-to-be-successful-in-the-role">Skills and experience we think you'll need to be successful in the role</h2>

<p>We are extremely proud of our culture and believe in the many benefits that being in the office provides and  all of our roles require regular time in one of our key offices depending on where you’re based (Hammersmith or Newcastle).  If we are able to support visa sponsorship for a role it will be highlighted in the requirements section.</p>
<p>We support flexible and hybrid working wherever possible but some roles remain fully office based.  Where we can support it,  typical working patterns would be 3 days in the office 2 days from home.  However, we appreciate everyone’s situation is unique and are open to conversations around the working patterns.  </p>
<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>At AnyVan we’re focused on equality.  We believe that diverse teams are the best teams and foster an inclusive environment where we celebrate our differences and where our people can be their authentic selves.  We believe this encourages collaboration and supports opportunities for our people and teams to deliver their best work.  We encourage and welcome applications from anyone that shares this passion.</p>
