<p>Lifelike human movement is a crucial part of making 3D animation feel real. However, digitising human movement is slow and expensive, requiring $10,000s-$1,000,000s to hand-animate each frame or using a special suit and studio.</p><p>Move AI is an applied AI research company that is transforming 3D creativity using motion, from a hobbyist in their bedroom to some of the largest organisations in the world (EA, Ubisoft and more). Through apps and APIs, we make animation 50x-1000x cheaper and faster, which will push the boundaries of how movement is used in spatial computing in ways we can’t yet imagine.</p><p>See for yourself how some of our ~3000 customers are already using us for User-Generated Content (UGC) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/643166402">(https://vimeo.com/643166402)</a>, Virtual Production <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/835727315?share=copy">(https://vimeo.com/835727315?share=copy)</a> and just for a bit of fun<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/806386728?share=copy"> (https://vimeo.com/806386728?share=copy)</a></p><h2>What is the role?</h2><p>As Product Design Lead, you will play a pivotal role in shaping the user experience and visual identity of the applications which interact with the Move Platform.
