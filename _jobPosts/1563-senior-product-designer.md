<h2>About Salary Finance</h2><p>Working with employers, we provide a financial wellbeing platform as an employee benefit, helping employees to understand their money better, get out of debt faster and save for their future. We already have a reach of over 4,000,000 employees through our relationships with over 600 of the biggest companies in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>By improving employee financial wellbeing, we have a very real and meaningful impact on people‚Äôs lives. We remove the stress and worry associated with financial difficulties by dramatically reducing the interest rates employees pay on their personal debt, and provide them with the tools needed to start saving sooner and be more financially secure. We are backed by some of the biggest brands, including investments from Blenheim Chalcot (the UK‚Äôs leading venture builder), Legal and General (the FTSE 100 insurer and asset manager), Experian and Goldman Sachs, and funding partnerships with JP Morgan and Virgin Money.&nbsp;</p><p>Launched in 2015, we have made excellent progress, and are scaling fast. We are named BITC‚Äôs Responsible Business of Year 2018, included in KPMG‚Äôs Global Fintech 100, listed top of the Forbes' list of socially-responsible startups, and profiled by the Financial Times, the Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, the Telegraph, CityAM and the Institute of Directors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Your role in our mission</h2><p>We are looking for an exceptional Senior Product Designer to join our dynamic and innovative Product Design team, contributing to shaping both the user experience and visual design of our products.</p><h2>About Product Design team</h2><p>We are a tightly-knit, highly collaborative Product Design team that comes together to shape, develop, and bring to life all user-facing elements of Salary Finance products.&nbsp;</p><p>Product Designers serve as strategic allies to both Engineering and Product Management within a dedicated product domain.
