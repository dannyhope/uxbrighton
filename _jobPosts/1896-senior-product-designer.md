<h2>About us</h2><p>Climate Policy Radar is a startup on a mission to organise, analyse, and democratise the world’s climate law and policy data. We build open databases and research tools so people can discover, understand and generate data-driven insights on public laws and policies.

This serves to enhance accountability, and promote data democratisation, transforming our search engine into a virtual research assistant for the climate world, powered by a unique open knowledge graph. We are deeply embedded in the global climate and AI communities, and count some of the most important organisations and global climate leaders amongst our users, advocates, friends and advisors.</p><p>We’re a Community Interest Company (CIC), championing an open science approach that aims to promote collaboration, transparency and justice including open code and data.
