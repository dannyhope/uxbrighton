<p>We are looking for someone to help us drive the next phase of growth at DrDoctor, leading a talented product design team through the execution of a recently refreshed strategy. As an experienced leader of design teams, you’ll be able to balance building a well-oiled product design function, as well as helping to shape our product vision and strategy.</p><p>Your authentic design leadership style has evolved from having bags of experience of designing brilliant products and managing projects from beginning to end, ensuring design efforts meet both user needs and business goals. You will be using that experience to help grow a team of research and design professionals who can create amazing user experiences. You’ll be able to show and share what successful design looks like and the value that it brings. Sometimes this may mean rolling up your sleeves to help guide the product and design team to design thoughtful and polished experiences.</p><p>Our design team serves a vital role at DrDoctor: our talented team of Product Designers are leading the way in UX and research methods, supported by enthusiastic engineering and product management functions. We’re looking for a Head of Design to help take our design function to the next level. This means: elevating our design craft, driving the growth and development of the team and improving our discovery and design processes. There’s lots of opportunity to influence what we do and how we do it at DrDoctor- we’re excited for you to help us deliver on our product vision to ensure the right patient is in the right place at the right time. You’ll be building on brilliant foundations, our product is loved by NHS healthcare teams and used by 21+ Million Patients across 50 NHS Trusts and Health Boards - we just hit 100 Million appointments.</p><h2>OK, that’s me, but who are DrDoctor?</h2><p>Take a look at our careers page (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://apply.workable.com/drdoctor/#jobs">https://apply.workable.com/drdoctor/#jobs</a>) to find out a bit more about our mission, vision, and impact!</p><p>But ultimately, we :green_heart: the NHS and want to help it work better. We radically transform the delivery of health services to make healthcare work for everyone – for patients, doctors, administrative teams and taxpayers.</p><h2>Nice! So in summary, what will I be doing?</h2><p>One of the great things about a scale-up is that every day is different and there is always an opportunity to get involved in something outside of your ‘BAU’!</p><p>However, the key things you could expect would include:</p><ul><li><p>Lead, develop, and inspire a team of product designers to create exceptional product experiences that not only meet business objectives but also deliver value for our NHS customers and patients. Use your knowledge to set the benchmark for what good design and design methodology looks like.</p></li><li><p>As part of the Product Leadership team, you will bring design thinking to the team, solve and unblock problems, and manage and optimise delivery processes and team topologies.</p></li><li><p>Help the organisation embed a build, measure, learn culture and transition in to hypothesis driven product development.</p></li><li><p>Develop the cross-functional process of continuous discovery, user research, and usability testing and build the design practices, processes, and principles to consistently deliver world class experiences to DrDoctor users and customers.</p></li><li><p>Influence and evangelize a great design culture as well as a highly collaborative environment throughout the organization. Spread the word of user-centred design practices across the business, embodying the needs and expectations of our users in everything you do.</p></li><li><p>Stay up-to-date with emerging technologies, tools, design trends and accessibility best practices, making recommendations on how to incorporate them into the design process to ensure we continue to innovate and stay ahead of the curve.</p></li><li><p>Foster a culture of healthy critique, where there is freedom to innovate, fail and learn.</p></li><li><p>Amplify the great work of the product design team by providing them the opportunity to grow and showcase their ability across the company.</p></li><li><p>Implement and manage the operations of product design across the business, interacting with other departments to ensure designers have everything they need to do their jobs to the best of their ability.</p></li><li><p>Use storytelling and persuasion to connect a strong design vision to the goals of our customers and the business.</p></li><li><p>Define, monitor and report experience quality across our products using a mixture of qual and quant metrics.</p></li></ul><h2>OK, I’m interested. What experience do I need to have?</h2><ul><li><p>Proven track record in building an exceptional design function, providing vision and strategic oversight, taking on organisational challenges and coaching and developing a team.</p></li><li><p>Experience developing product vision and strategy and helping peers translate that into product roadmaps and experiences.</p></li><li><p>Leadership and mentoring experience, coaching, and teaching the craft of design to your team. You have experience building a team while maintaining a great culture and are willing and able to be hands on as needed.</p></li><li><p>A stellar product design portfolio that demonstrates a user-centered design approach, exceptional problem-solving skills, a deep understanding of mobile and web design best practice and a successful track record of impacting business outcomes.</p></li><li><p>Substantial experience working across the end-to-end design process, with a particular strength in coaching teams in turning user research into thoughtful and impactful experiences.</p></li><li><p>Excellent communicator – active listener, confident writer and speaker. You are able to communicate easily with product managers, designers, engineers, senior leadership and other key stakeholders.</p></li><li><p>Experience creating strategic and scalable design processes and systems in a fast-paced environment.</p></li><li><p>Comfortable working in spaces with significant ambiguity, driving good product discovery practices.</p></li><li><p>Experience creating a culture of healthy critique within design teams to drive practice and craft forward. You lead by example when giving and receiving feedback.</p></li></ul><h2>Nice to have</h2><ul><li><p>Experience in healthcare or a highly regulated sector.</p></li><li><p>Experience working in fast-growth / scale-up organisations.</p></li></ul><p>We know from research and experience that candidates may not apply if they don’t think they meet 100% of our requirements. If you don’t tick all the boxes but feel you would be a good fit, we would still love to hear from you. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive culture!</p><p>Just to let you know too, we will need you to have the Right To Work in the UK, and as we work closely with the NHS, if we get to the stage where we make you an offer to join us, we will also need to undertake a DBS check.</p><h2>We are perfect for each other, what are the next steps?</h2><p>We are currently recruiting heavily and have a lot of CVs to go through.

However, if you want more details as to why, just drop us a note and we will arrange to get some feedback over to you.</p><p>If it’s a match, then we will arrange a time to talk to you on a quick 30 minute call. It’s just an informal chat so you can relax! We will tell you more about the role, the team and why you should want to join us.</p><p>If we continue, then we will invite you to meet some of the team, most likely virtually. Some of our roles will also be subject to completing an assessment or a role related exercise.</p><p>We get there are a lot of great roles out there, so we will make sure to get through the rounds as quickly as possible.
