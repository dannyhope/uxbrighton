<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>At Learnosity we believe education and learning opportunities should be equitable, inclusive and accessible to all. Our mission is to advance education and learning worldwide with best-in-class technology. We are geeks at heart, we love what we do and we’re looking for passionate and talented people to join our growing team.</p>
<p>After acquiring Questionmark, we are searching for our next talented Product Designer (UX/UI). This is a full-time position where you’ll be working with your local teams in UK &amp; Ireland, and our larger design team operating out of Sydney, Australia. Time zones can sometimes be tricky, but we believe we can make it work through frequent and effective communication.</p>
<p>Your day-to-day will involve using the design thinking methodology to deliver new solutions in our Questionmark platform, an end-to-end educational product where customers can create their users, author questions, schedule &amp; deliver assessments, and harness reports. Plus much more! There is a large opportunity to shape your career's next steps through this role, and to make a meaningful change to a product ready to welcome a new designer with open arms.</p>
<p>This position is for a candidate who is resourceful and proactive, based on the nature of working with the local team in the UK, and the full design team located in Sydney. This role reports into the VP of Design in Sydney, Australia but will have local Product Managers in the same time zone on day to day project work.</p>
<p><strong>Please note, it is very important you are aware of the expectations of being the only local designer</strong> - the full design team are very supportive within the small window of opportunity the time zone provides.</p>

<li>Motivation to lead projects in a highly collaborative environment,</li>
<li>A minimum of 4 years experience in a team responsible for shipping products/features,</li>
<li>Proven experience of the end-to-end design thinking process, from research &amp; discovery to design delivery in an Agile setup,</li>
<li>Experience designing for accessibility standards is a bonus,</li>
<li>A proven track record of building interfaces and interactions for web-based experiences that adhere to design best practices,</li>
<li>Experience with design systems, using and contributing to one</li>
<li>An open mindset to pivoting when competing work requires prioritising,</li>
<li>Rock-solid communication skills,</li>
<li>Fluent written &amp; spoken English</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra bits we look for in our teammates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showcasing the value of design, and the positive impacts that can be made through the iterative design process,</li>
<li>Building productive and rewarding team relationships,</li>
<li>Exercising empathy for different perspectives,</li>
<li>Remaining flexible enough to consider different ways of doing things,</li>
<li>Providing thoughtful approaches to problem solving, and contributing to the team strategies,</li>
<li>Self-improvement and progression as a Product Designer,</li>
<li>Fostering an environment where all members feel welcome to contribute</li>
</ul>
<p>If successful you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be part of a diverse and globally connected team</li>
<li>Use industry leading tools such as Figma, Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, user feedback software, online white boarding tools and more,</li>
<li>Be empowered to create new or refined experiences in the Questionmark portal,</li>
<li>Connect with our customers and users (this is key to success for the role),</li>
<li>Have actual impact on a product used by hundreds of thousands or learners over the globe.</li>
