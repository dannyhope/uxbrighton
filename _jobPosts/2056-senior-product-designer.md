We’re working to build a supportive and inclusive environment where collaboration is encouraged and learning is shared. We value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.&nbsp;</p><p>We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.</p><h2>Hybrid working</h2><p>It’s hugely important for us to be able to share knowledge and establish relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we’ve decided to follow a hybrid model, and for full time positions we would&nbsp;<strong>require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week</strong> (currently Tue, Wed, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). For part time positions this may vary.&nbsp; As an equal opportunities employer we are committed to building an equal and inclusive team. If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.</p><p><strong>Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/applicant-and-candidate-privacy-policy"><strong>privacy policy</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
