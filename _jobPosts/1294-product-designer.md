We‚Äôre food industry natives. We‚Äôve worked in busy kitchens and run busy restaurant franchises.

But, this all depends on our employees. And that‚Äôs because we trust our employees to define what sort of an employer Flipdish is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Transparency is hugely important to us. We listen to one another. We collaborate. And we give everyone a way to grow their careers through a supportive environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We‚Äôre a company that values diversity, inclusion, and wellbeing as standard. We believe in balance, not burnout. Every Wednesday is meeting-free and we get Summer Fridays (Fridays off during the summer). And all permanent employees qualify for our share scheme because we share our success.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://flexa.careers/companies/flipdish">We‚Äôre flexible employers.</a> We have teams based on both sides of the Atlantic who get their jobs done both from home and from some of our beautiful offices in bustling cities like New York, London, Barcelona, and Dublin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;So, if you want to join a genuinely friendly team, take a look at our current openings and get in touch.
