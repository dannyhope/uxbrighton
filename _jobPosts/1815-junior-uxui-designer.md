<h2>The Role&nbsp;</h2><p>At Charles Tyrwhitt our purpose is to “Make it easy for men to dress well” and we can’t do that without our specialist teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This time, we’re on the lookout for a Junior UX Designer who will be working with Aleksandra from our eCommerce team. &nbsp;</p><h2>What you will be doing</h2><p>The primary purpose of the UX/UI Designer is to drive, design and execute best-in-class user experiences across Charles Tyrwhitt’s digital commerce estate. We are looking for someone who is able to anticipate what our customers need and to design the experience for our digital future.&nbsp;</p><p>You will liaise with key stakeholders across the business along with the UX/CRO Manager, Head of Web Merchandising and the Ecommerce Director to understand business requirements and create researched, validated and designed change requirements for digital projects and enhancements.&nbsp;</p><h2>What we are looking for&nbsp;</h2><p>How we do our work is important to us at CT and anyone who joins us will feel aligned with our 3 BE’s: “BE the BOSS”, “BE the CUSTOMER” and “BE the BEST”.&nbsp;</p><p>As a creative and entrepreneurial business, we believe that being together helps create a collaborative environment and is key to our success. Our Tyrwhitteers are the drivers of change, so we’re looking for hard working people with a pro-active approach to their work.</p><p>The Junior UX Designer specifically requires someone with experience working with highly visible consumer apps and overseeing the design process from concept to implementation.</p><p>You’ll have experience with typical UX tools (Figma) and have the ability to work well under pressure with challenging deadlines whilst balancing the “good enough” vs “perfection”.</p><h2><strong>Who we are&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Once upon a shirt, Nicholas Charles Tyrwhitt Wheeler (whilst studying Geography at Bristol University – we might add) had the notion that he could make a better shirt at better value than anyone else in the world! He believed that all men; no matter their shape or size, where they may be in the world or indeed their budget; should be able to own a Jermyn Street quality shirt. A proper shirt. A CT shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of a chap’s entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.&nbsp;</p><p>Our spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s famous Jermyn Street. Our Global Head Office is in London Bridge, whilst we also have an office in Manhattan to support our retail and online presence across North America, Europe and Australia. Not forgetting our Distribution Centre and Contact Centre in Milton Keynes.&nbsp;</p><p>At Charles Tyrwhitt we believe in doing the right thing. That means making our&nbsp;products properly and sustainably, making our business work for our people, our customers, and our suppliers and giving back to charity to support those in need. We’re taking a good hard look at our social and environmental impact, and always looking for ways to be better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘I am Proud and Free to be me!’</strong></p><p>When it comes to our people, we really do “Give a shirt”.</p><p>Tyrwhitteers (our people) are a diverse, passionate and entrepreneurial bunch. We enjoy a fun, engaging and rewarding culture, where everyone is empowered by our 3 BE-liefs which are; “BE the BOSS”, “BE the CUSTOMER” and “BE the BEST”.</p>
