<h2>Job Description</h2><p>We’d all like amazing work to do, and real work-life balance. That’s waiting for you at Sainsbury’s. Think about the scale it takes for us to feed the nation. The level of data, transactions and variety it involves. Then you’ll realise that ours is a modern software engineering environment because it has to be. We’ve made serious investment into a Tech Academy and into setting standards and principles. We iterate, learn, experiment and push ways of working such as Agile, Scrum and XP. So you can look forward to awesome opportunities in everything from AI to reusable tech.</p><p>At Sainsbury’s we believe that the customer should be at the heart of everything we do.&nbsp;Our vision is to create the easiest, most enjoyable experiences that better serve our customers’ ever-changing needs. We work across a range of services, products, touch points and tools to deliver distinctive, integrated, and consistent experiences for our customers and colleagues across Sainsbury’s Group (which includes Sainsbury’s Food, Argos, Bank, Nectar, Tu and Habitat).</p><p>We drive brilliant experiences across all our brands in-store and online, operating in agile teams and squads, working seamlessly with teams right across the business to make the most of the exceptional knowledge, insight and talent we have.</p><h2>The role</h2><p>You'll be working on Sainsbury’s digital products within our <strong>customer in-store team</strong>.

This is challenging because the problems are complex and solving a problem could have a knock-on effect elsewhere. That's why you'll learn the wider context of how our stores and business works. You'll do this working with people from across the group, who will all have different knowledge, perspectives and opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The changes you make will impact millions of customers in one of the UK's largest retailers.&nbsp;</p><h2>What you'll do</h2><ul><li><p>Research customer needs through observation and interviews&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Organise and conduct in-store and remote research&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Interact with stakeholders from across the group to share insights and ideas&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Design and test concepts and solutions&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with diverse teams from different disciplines&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Champion inclusive design principles in your work and throughout the team&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Work within agile teams to get your solutions in to the hands of our customers&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What we're looking for</h2><p>Industry experience as a UX, Product or Service Designer is essential.
