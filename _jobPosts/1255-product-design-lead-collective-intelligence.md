<h2 id="about-nesta">About Nesta</h2>
<p>We are Nesta, the UK’s innovation agency for social good. We design, test and scale solutions to society’s biggest problems. Our three missions are to give every child a fair start, help people live healthy lives, and create a sustainable future where the economy works for both people and the planet.</p>
<p>For over 20 years, we have worked to support, encourage and inspire innovation. We work in three roles: as an innovation partner working with frontline organisations to design and test new solutions, as a venture builder supporting new and early stage businesses, and as a system shaper creating the conditions for innovation.</p>
<p>Harnessing the rigour of science and the creativity of design, we work relentlessly to change millions of lives for the better. Find out more at <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/">nesta.org.uk</a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design helps create new ways for communities to use technology to harness their insights, ideas and power to act on the problems that matter to them and create the futures they want. We know well-designed systems can help promote healthy collective action at scale, but too often technology is designed to solve the needs of individuals or large organisations.</p>
<p>Our mission is to design digital tools and products that allow communities to respond collectively to challenges, and that help public and voluntary sector institutions strengthen trust and collaboration with citizens.</p>
<p>We help our partners to understand where and how collective intelligence approaches can help address the problems they’re working on. We apply collective intelligence design - which brings together insights from diverse groups of people, with new sources of data (such as sensor or mobile phone data) and digital technologies (including AI) - to develop bespoke solutions to those problems. We use rigorous research methods to test, learn and evaluate each solution.</p>
<h2 id="the-role">The Role</h2>
<p>Nesta is looking for an exceptional end-to-end digital product designer to lead the design and prototyping of new digital ‘collective intelligence’ solutions. At the heart of CI design is the ability to effectively combine insights and actions of large crowds, data and digital technologies to tackle complex social challenges. This is a unique opportunity to apply, shape and develop expertise in an emerging area of innovation practice, working with our partners and clients all over the world in a social-purpose enterprise. As well as leading the development of new collective intelligence solutions, you’ll support and mentor your direct reports, and help advance our own practice - drawing on our key resources including the <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/toolkit/collective-intelligence-design-playbook/">Collective Intelligence Design Playbook</a>. As part of an interdisciplinary team, you’ll work with the Centre’s software developers, researchers and product managers to create high impact digital solutions, tools and and services to help tackle climate change, improve health and increase civic and democratic participation. And you’ll draw on a wide range of collective intelligence methods from crowdsourcing, to citizen science and online deliberation.</p>
