<h4><strong>About CUR8</strong></h4><p>The science is clear: even if we do everything else right on reducing emissions, the world needs to remove 200 Gigatonnes of carbon from the atmosphere by 2050.</p><p>We have decades of experience working with the leading climate change actors, which we combine with deep technical and business expertise to build the carbon removals industry faster than ever before.</p><p>We partner with providers of the highest quality carbon removals, and we don’t stop there; developing carbon markets creates an unprecedented opportunity for the creation of innovation, value, equity, and jobs across the world. We believe the supply side of carbon removals is the biggest opportunity for our business and for the world.</p><p>We’re systemic thinkers. Together with our sister NGO, Rethinking Removals, we collaborate with the entire carbon removals ecosystem, across suppliers, buyers, policymakers, and narrative setters, together to develop and invest in future projects to make sure there are enough carbon removals in 1, 5, 10 and 25 years time.</p><h2><strong>About our team</strong></h2><p>We’re a small but mighty team; between us, we’ve built, scaled, and sold successful tech businesses, advised governments on net zero, shaped global narratives at Nature, New Scientist, and the BBC, led startup support and investments at Google, invested in and built carbon removal startups.
