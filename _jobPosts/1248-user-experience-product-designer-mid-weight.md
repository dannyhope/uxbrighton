<p><strong>Data and Statistics Division(DSD)</strong> is the Bank’s centre of expertise for compilation, dissemination and publication of regulatory and statistical data, promoting innovation and quality to support analysis, policy and decision making by the Bank’s Committees, UK government departments and international organisations.</p>
<p>Data is collected from banks and buildings societies, credit unions, insurance companies and regulated mortgage lenders and administrators. This takes place via 35 statistical collections and over 200 regulatory collections.</p>
<p>We cleanse a sizeable proportion of these datasets and publish a large number of Statistical data via our interactive database. We support MPC, FPC and PRA Board and our data are used in the Inflation Report, Financial Stability Report, Credit Conditions Review, Stress Test Results, FPC Core Indicators and Quarterly Bulletin.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 plus people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.</p>
<p>**This role operates in the Service Design team within the Data Collections Transformation Programme. **</p>
<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
<p>The Bank of England has embarked on an ambitious transformation program to overhaul the way we collect and use financial data. Currently, the Bank is a data collection and processing engine. Data is collected from banks and buildings societies, credit unions, insurance companies and regulated mortgage lenders and administrators. This takes place via 35 statistical collections and over 200 regulatory collections.</p>
<p>The Transforming Data Collection program focuses on improving the way the Bank gets data, in order to better support our experts in shaping the UK economy. For this strategic endeavour we need great people to help us to get it right.</p>
<p>Situated within a traditional business, we operate with a start up mentality. Our transformation program is founded on a service design approach, addressing end-to-end journeys which cut across multiple services, institutions, digital systems and offline processes.</p>
<p>You can read more about the Transforming Data Collection (TDC) program on our <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2021/transforming-data-collection-from-the-uk-financial-sector-a-plan-for-2021-and-beyond">website</a>.</p>

You will work closely with user researchers to understand how users currently experience our services and what it would take to improve these.

Day-to-day, you may work with data specialists and policymakers to understand and improve existing experiences and coming up with new ones.</p>
<p>You will be supported by the Lead Product Designer and Service Design Manager - both of whom have decades of design experience.</p>

<h2 id="why-join-the-transforming-data-collection-program-at-the-bank-of-england">Why Join the Transforming Data Collection program at the Bank of England</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because what we do is important. Getting good data is critical for the Bank of England to do its job. The governor and deputy governors of the Bank know this. That’s why they put their name to the program.</li>
<li>Because it’s exciting to innovate inside a 300 year old institution. We like to think and do things differently. And it’s exciting to bring new ideas and new ways of working to a place with so much history.</li>
<li>Because we are a diverse and inclusive bunch. Our work is all about bringing people together that come from different backgrounds and have different ideas. That ethos applies to our team and everything we do.</li>
<li>Because we support and empower each other. We have a lot to do! To do everything requires us to be the best we can be. That’s why we think it is important to invest in ourselves and each other. We believe everyone in our team has strengths which everyone else can learn from. And the data says this is more than just talk. In surveys, our division’s top scores are on ‘growth’ and ‘recognition and feedback’, with [80%] of people saying they would recommend their manager to others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-approach-to-inclusion">Our Approach to Inclusion</h2>
<p>The Bank values diversity, equity and inclusion. We play a key role in maintaining monetary and financial stability, and to do that effectively, we believe we need a workforce that reflects the society we serve. </p>
<p>At the Bank of England we want all colleagues to feel valued and respected, so we're working hard to build an inclusive culture which supports people from all backgrounds and communities to be at their best at work. We celebrate all forms of diversity, including (but not limited to) age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. We believe that it’s by drawing on different perspectives and experiences that we’ll continue to make the best decisions for the public.</p>
<p>We welcome applications from individuals who work flexibly, including job shares and part time working patterns. We've also partnered with external organisations to support us in making adjustments for candidates and employees in the recruitment process where they're needed.</p>
<p>For most roles where work can be carried out at home, we aim for colleagues to spend half of their time in the office, with a minimum of 40% per month.  Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them, their team and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Finally, we're proud to be a member of the Disability Confident scheme.  You can find more information on what this means <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability-confident-guidance-for-levels-1-2-and-3/level-2-disability-confident-employer">here</a>.
