In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‚Äòno‚Äô. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer ‚Äì and it was broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The industry was backward-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?&nbsp;</p><p>No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more information regarding our Privacy Policy and practices, please visit:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://oaknorth.co.uk/legal/privacy-notice/employees-and-visitors/">https://oaknorth.co.uk/legal/privacy-notice/employees-and-visitors/</a></p>
