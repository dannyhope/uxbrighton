<h2>About us</h2><p>We are Direct Line Group – home to some of the country's best-known brands including Direct Line, Churchill, Privilege, Greenflag and NIG.</p><p>We are looking for a <strong>UX designer</strong> to join our <strong>Experience Design Team</strong> here at DLG. The Experience Design Team is a group of passionate people who specialise in Research, UX, Design, and Content. You will be a mid-weight UX Designer who is customer obsessed with an eye for commercial results. You will not be afraid to challenge the norm and what's gone before. You will genuinely want to create brilliant experiences for our customers and our colleagues.</p><p>We work in an agile way, so that means you will work as part of a cross-functional squad focused on a product or journey. Your squad colleagues will include engineers, data analysts, product specialists, and product owners.</p><p>We are moving to a new London office in the London Bridge area in August, and as part of that we are investing in building a dedicated <strong>User Experience Test Suite</strong>. A state-of-the-art two-room facility where we can conduct our own in-house user research. It'll have all the kit we need to do our own moderated research sessions with colleagues and customers.</p><h2>Our team purpose…</h2><p>We take experience design seriously. It's our passion. And we're on a mission to help the rest of our DLG colleagues understand the importance of being customer obsessed. That's why we've created our own team manifesto, to help articulate why we are here, and the way that we do things:</p><ul><li><p>We believe in connecting people with brands through experiences</p></li><li><p>We represent the customer in every conversation, and every decision</p></li><li><p>We create memorable experiences that delight our customers and deliver value</p></li><li><p>We interrogate data and insight to inform everything we do</p></li><li><p>We enlighten our colleagues by bringing them closer to our customers</p></li><li><p>We inspire our people, creating an environment to grow and do their best work</p></li></ul><h2>What you'll be doing:</h2><ul><li><p>You will solve problems through design thinking. You will understand a problem, and work with your colleagues to solve that problem – through insight-driven UX design</p></li><li><p>You'll conduct UX research using multiple methodologies (lab, online panel, survey, colleague, guerrilla)</p></li><li><p>You'll be comfortable presenting your findings to your colleagues and partners at all levels</p></li></ul><h2>What you'll need:</h2><ul><li><p>You will have a data driven mind. You'll be curious and hungry for the data to help inform the decisions you make and the UX design approach you take</p></li><li><p>You will be a strong collaborator. Bringing people along with you. Working in isolation isn't your style - you need to enjoy being part of a multi-disciplined team and recognise the crafts and expertise of your colleagues</p></li><li><p>Naturally you'll have experience of the tools of your trade - Figma, Sketch, Adobe, Invision,and more.</p></li><li><p>You'll also be able to demonstrate your use of data and insight from tools like ContentSquare and test platforms like UserZoom and Kameleoon</p></li></ul><h2>What we'll give you:</h2><p>You'll be surrounded by passionate, customer obsessed people who want to make a difference. If you want to develop your technical and personal skills, we'll be there for you – as little or as much as you want. You'll grow if you're willing to put the time into your development.</p><p>Experience Design love their Macs, and we believe you need to have the right kit and tools to do your best work. We've integrated our Macs into our DLG technology systems so that means you have access to everything you need as a DLG colleague.</p><h2>Ways of Working</h2><p>You will be London-based, but we work in a hybrid way. Our new London office at Riverbank House opens in August and it's been designed to be a space for collaboration. Whilst there is no expectation for a fixed routine, it's likely that you'll work from there a couple of days a week. Some weeks it could be more or less – that's down to the routines of the teams that you are working with, and also your own working pattern. It's a brand new workplace and we're hoping it will be <strong>the place</strong> where collaboration and new ideas happens.</p><p>Read our flexible working approach <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.directlinegroupcareers.com/flexible-working/">here</a>.</p><h2>Benefits</h2><p>We recognise we wouldn't be where we are today without our colleagues, that's why we offer excellent benefits designed to suit your lifestyle:</p><ul><li><p>9% employer contributed pension</p></li><li><p>50% off home, motor and pet insurance plus free travel insurance and Green Flag breakdown cover</p></li><li><p>Additional optional Health and Dental insurance</p></li><li><p>EV car scheme allows all colleagues to lease a brand new electric or plug-in hybrid car in a tax efficient way.</p></li><li><p>Generous holidays</p></li><li><p>Buy as you earn share scheme</p></li><li><p>Employee discounts and cashback</p></li><li><p>Plus many more</p></li></ul><h2>Being yourself</h2><p>Direct Line Group is an equal opportunity employer, and we think diversity of background and thinking is a big strength in our people. We're delighted to feature as one of the UK's Top 50 Inclusive Employers and are committed to making our business an inclusive place to work, where everyone can be themselves and succeed in their careers.</p><p>We know you're more than a CV, and the things that make you, you, are what bring potential to our business. We recognise and embrace people that work in different ways so if you need any adjustments to our recruitment process, please speak to the recruitment team who will be happy to support you.</p><p>#L1-MW1</p><p>#L1-Hybrid</p>
