<h2>Life at Deliveroo&nbsp;</h2><p>We are a growing team, with very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.</p><p>There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.</p><h2>&nbsp;The Role</h2><p>Working with Product Design and Content Design as part of the Deliveroo Experience team, user research defines how customers, riders, restaurants and employees interact with Deliveroo's products. Based in London, our work as researchers takes us to restaurant kitchens in Paris, riders in Amsterdam and customers' homes in Singapore.</p><p>As a Senior User Researcher at Deliveroo, you'll work with teams across the entire company to help them build understanding of the people they serve every day. You'll report into our Senior Product Design Manager and work on a hybrid basis, with the opportunity to come into the office as desired.</p><p>&nbsp;On a daily basis, you will:</p><ul><li><p>Manage the planning, delivery and analysis of research projects that support and inform your team's work both in the short- and long-term</p></li><li><p>Shape strategy for your product area together with product managers</p></li><li><p>Contribute to cross-team initiatives that make the Content, Research &amp; Design practice at Deliveroo better – including improving our hiring process, expanding our community presence, interviewing potential new team members, and much more</p></li><li><p>Work in the way that works for you. You'll contribute new techniques, methods and ways of working that the team can learn from.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;The products we work on are as diverse as the users we serve. We're fortunate to be in a company where User Research is truly valued across the organisation. So during your time at Deliveroo, you'll experience all sides of our marketplace, from our Riders and Restaurants to our Customers and Employees.</p><h2>&nbsp;Requirements</h2><p>&nbsp;This role is for you if you:</p><ul><li><p>Have a natural understanding of people, their motivations and thought processes</p></li><li><p>Have several years' experience working in User Research, working on both formative and evaluative research projects</p></li><li><p>Are comfortable using different methodologies, e.g. interviews, diary studies, ethnography, surveys, usability testing</p></li><li><p>Are comfortable presenting research findings to senior stakeholders, and working with them to inform business and product strategy</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Benefits and Diversity</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer many great benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation. We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.</p>
