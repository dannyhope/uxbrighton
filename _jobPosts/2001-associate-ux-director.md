<h2>Why should I Apply</h2><p>At Sonar, we’re a group of brilliant, motivated, and driven professionals working hard to help organizations build responsible, secure, high-quality code quickly and systematically. We build solutions that don’t just solve symptoms of problems – we fix problems at the source – source code, to be specific.</p><p>We have a dynamic culture with employees worldwide and hub offices in the USA, Switzerland, France, the UK, Singapore, and Germany. We believe team members should have the opportunity to come to work every day, work on a product they are proud of, love what they do, and feel energized by their peers. With our roots deep in the open source community, we’re all about the mission: provide solutions that deliver Clean Code.</p><h2>The impact you will have &nbsp;</h2><p>Ask a friend or colleague developer about Sonar or SonarQube. They have heard from us and will likely use the products. This is how significant our impact on the tech industry is.</p><p>The UX craft has been gradually evolving at Sonar, and there is still much to do. In 2023, UX benchmarked a solid stage 3 of the NNG maturity model at Sonar, with a strong appetite to evolve from there in the next few years. We hold ourselves to high standards, and we are looking for invested, resilient, and humble professionals to join us for the journey ahead.</p><p>Your experience sets you apart, and for some time, you have been paving the way for UX professionals. You create a plan for the team, including managing the agenda, proactively raising topics, providing the necessary resources, and aligning objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>You will adopt standards and ensure the team uses/follows them. You will present solutions to problems and use your own or the team’s creativity to find solutions while clearly managing expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Your proactive thinking across the team and your ability to engage colleagues outside the team when needed are highly valued. You are expected to set an example through your actions, which you consistently do.&nbsp;</p><p>Flexible over fixed, collaborative over withdrawn, and willing to go the extra mile. You excel at developing direct reports and supporting other colleagues cross-functionally, and clearly understand the job of the team and what the team needs to be successful.</p><p>You will work in a tech-heavy environment with Engineers, UX Designers, and Product Managers. You embrace and navigate the complexity of software development, dealing with terminology and taxonomy likely beyond anything you have ever faced, and be expected to deliver product experiences to one of the most knowledgeable, pragmatic, and engaged crafts in the digital space besides your software engineers.</p><h2>On a daily basis, you will</h2><ul><li><p>Represent the UX in your DomainManage UX designers and UX ResearchersBe responsible for the group that can be between 3-7 people</p></li><li><p>Ensure that the team is receiving feedback regularly</p></li><li><p>Report on staffing needsRecommend hiring priorities</p></li><li><p>Be the hiring manager when reinforcing UX</p></li><li><p>Ensure that the domain follows the global UX direction</p></li><li><p>Advocate/champion for UX</p></li><li><p>Connect the UX effort with the product and business strategy of your domain</p></li><li><p>Track and report on the current domain workload and deliveries</p></li><li><p>Evolve the existing career architecture and leveling frameworks</p></li><li><p>Ensure team members are engaged, satisfied with work, and have a chance to grow in a continuous manner</p></li><li><p>Ensure that there is a good level of communication and collaboration within the Domain</p></li><li><p>Update the existing onboarding content at the domain level</p></li><li><p>Ensure the right level of cross-domain collaboration</p></li><li><p>Align the deliveries of this with other domains</p></li><li><p>Accountable for the UX metrics being tracked and delivering business value</p></li></ul><h2>The technical skills you demonstrate</h2><ul><li><p>Design</p></li><li><p>Research</p></li><li><p>Talent development</p></li><li><p>Change Management</p></li><li><p>Group Leadership and Culture</p></li><li><p>Systems Thinking</p></li><li><p>People Management and Strategy</p></li></ul><h2>The soft skills you demonstrate</h2><ul><li><p>Strategic Thinking</p></li><li><p>Empathy</p></li><li><p>Flexibility</p></li><li><p>Decisiveness</p></li><li><p>Dependability</p></li><li><p>Persuasion and influence</p></li><li><p>Public Speaking</p></li></ul><h2>The business competences you demonstrate</h2><ul><li><p>Stakeholder management</p></li><li><p>Forward planning and outcome-setting</p></li><li><p>Product thinking</p></li><li><p>Commercial awareness</p></li><li><p>Customer-Centric Mindset</p></li><li><p>Constraint management</p></li></ul><p>We value diverse talents and encourage you to apply even if your skills differ from those listed.</p><h2>Why you will love it here</h2><p>• Our culture and mission set us apart. We have a dynamic work culture that values respect and kindness – and embraces the right to fail (and get right back up again!). We believe that the best idea wins and everyone has a voice.</p><p>• We believe that great people make a great company. We value people skills as much as technical skills and strive to keep things friendly and laid-back while still being passionate leaders in our domains. Our 550+ SonarSourcers from 33 different nationalities can relate!</p><p>• We embrace work-life balance. It is important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This is why we have a flexible work policy that includes remote and in-office hybrid work.</p><p>• We have a growth mindset. We love to learn and believe that continuous education is critical to our success. In an ever-changing industry, new skills are a must, and we're happy to help our team acquire them.</p><h2>We prioritize Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2><p>At Sonar, we are a global workforce and recognize the value of different backgrounds, and global cultures.</p><p>We are committed to creating a diverse work environment and are proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.</p><p><em>All offers of employment at Sonar are contingent upon the clear results of a comprehensive background check conducted prior to the start date.</em></p>
