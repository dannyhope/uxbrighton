<h2>About Harry’s&nbsp;</h2><p>Harry’s Inc. started in 2013 with a specific goal: disrupt the shaving industry by creating an innovative, everyday product at a fair price. Since then, Harry’s has expanded to Canada and Europe, developed relationships with retailers such as Target and Walmart, expanded our grooming brand into a personal care powerhouse, launched two new brands including Flamingo and Cat Person, and made our first brand acquisition with Lumē.&nbsp;</p><p>The key to our success? Our amazing people. From chemists, mechanical engineers, CX associates, to creative directors, sourcing managers, and logistics specialists, the Harry’s team is composed of some of the most brilliant, diverse, and humble people you’ll ever meet.&nbsp;</p><p>Our brands answer unmet consumer needs, but our company is a place of inclusion and innovation that attracts some of the brightest minds across industries, geographies, and backgrounds. Whether we have a team of 5 or 500, our core values and our startup mentality remain; we value continuous improvement and learning, teamwork and collaboration, creative problem solving, and open and direct dialogue and feedback.</p><p>As a Junior Graphic Designer/Product Designer at Harry’s Inc., you will play a crucial role in our design and creative team, responsible for crafting visual elements that complement our products and websites. This position combines the roles of a product designer and a graphic designer, making it a unique opportunity to contribute to both aspects of our business.</p><h2>Product and Graphic Design at Harry’s Inc.</h2><p>At Harry’s Inc., you'll work side-by-side with the Senior Manager of Product Design &amp; Creative, the Product Design Associate, the Graphic Designer, Engineers, Product Managers, the brand and retail teams to turn the ideas we co-create into beautiful, thoughtful web experiences that resonate with our customers across our Harry’s and Flamingo EU and UK sites, as well as our internal tool. You'll not only prototype detailed stories but also infuse them with visually captivating graphics, creating pixel-perfect designs that bring it all together. Your skills as a graphic designer will shine as you craft compelling visuals, emails and imagery that enhance the overall user experience. You'll also assist with day-to-day design tasks, ensuring that every visual aspect meets our high standards. We'll launch, measure, and iterate experiences until we find the right answer for our customers. And, as a key part of the process, you'll structure, manage, and create these experiences using atomic design methods, incorporating graphics that align with our design system and storybook. This holistic approach will clearly communicate your component-based designs to engineering, creating a seamless fusion of product and graphic design. Let’s do this!</p><h2>About You</h2><p>To you, there's nothing more addictive than making things that matter and showing them to people, especially through the power of graphic design. You have a knack for creating intuitive, scalable, and visually stunning product designs that not only function flawlessly but also captivate users through your exceptional graphic design skills. You represent the users every step of the way, keeping them at the heart of what you’re building, ensuring that the aesthetics and functionality go hand in hand. You understand that authenticity, clarity, and transparency are the keystones of successful modern brands, and you’re excited by the prospect of building one with a strong graphic identity. Thinking about information architecture, hierarchy, user flows, and UI patterns is second nature to you, and you infuse these elements with your graphic design prowess. You not only understand why you designed something, but you can also visually advocate for it in a team environment while collaborating with product managers and engineers. You’re naturally curious and enjoy taking an interest in things outside of design, using that knowledge to further your own work and build your perspectives, including the world of graphic design. Your ability to blend graphic design seamlessly into the product design process is a testament to your multifaceted design talent.</p><h2>Key Responsibilities</h2><p><em>Product Design (50%):</em></p><ul><li><p>Work closely with the Product Design team to create user-focused, intuitive, and visually appealing digital experiences.</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with product managers and engineers to turn concepts into pixel-perfect designs using tools like Figma.</p></li><li><p>Assist in creating prototypes and micro-interactions to enhance the user experience.</p></li><li><p>Contribute to the maintenance and expansion of our design system, ensuring a consistent and scalable approach to design.</p></li><li><p>Participate in user testing and feedback sessions to refine and optimise designs.</p></li><li><p>Support cross-functional teams in defining requirements, synthesising ideas, and validating designs.</p></li><li><p>Analyse test results, identify trends and insights, and make recommendations for site improvements.</p></li></ul><p><em>Graphic Design (50%):</em></p><ul><li><p>Collaborate with the design team to create compelling visual assets for our websites, marketing materials, and packaging.</p></li><li><p>Design and produce graphics for both digital and print, ensuring they adhere to brand guidelines.</p></li><li><p>Develop and maintain a consistent visual identity across all our brands, including Harry’s, Flamingo, and Cat Person.</p></li><li><p>Produce marketing collateral, social media content, email campaigns, and advertisements that resonate with our target audience.</p></li><li><p>Participate in brainstorming sessions to generate creative ideas for visual storytelling and promotional materials.</p></li><li><p>Assist in photo editing and retouching for product and lifestyle images.</p></li><li><p>Stay up-to-date with design trends and emerging tools to enhance our creative processes.</p></li></ul><h2>This describes you</h2><p><em>Product Design (50%):</em></p><ul><li><p>Familiarity with UX/UI design principles and best practices.</p></li><li><p>Experience with design tools like Figma for creating prototypes and pixel-perfect designs.</p></li><li><p>Interest in user-centered design and the ability to advocate for user needs in a team environment.</p></li><li><p>A curious mindset and a willingness to explore new design trends and techniques.</p></li><li><p>Ability to work collaboratively with product managers and engineers to bring designs to life.</p></li></ul><p><em>Graphic Design (50%):</em></p><ul><li><p>A portfolio showcasing a range of graphic design skills, including web and print design, visual storytelling, and marketing collateral.</p></li><li><p>Proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite or other design tools.</p></li><li><p>Understanding of design principles, typography, color theory, and layout composition.</p></li><li><p>Ability to work in a fast-paced environment, prioritise tasks, and meet deadlines.</p></li><li><p>Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.</p></li><li><p>Detail-oriented and receptive to feedback.</p></li></ul><h2><br>Bonus points if you have</h2><ul><li><p>Experience working in the EU market, especially Germany.</p></li><li><p>Proficiency with project management tools like Jira.</p></li><li><p>Passion for using Figma &amp; FigJam for design collaboration.</p></li><li><p>Understanding of design-based code languages.</p></li><li><p>Understanding of UK/EU accessibility standards and guidelines</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please include a case study or portfolio (docs, website, work samples, Dribbble, etc.) in your application.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></h2><ul><li><p>A chance to work in a rapidly growing company with ample opportunities for professional development.</p></li><li><p>A dynamic and inclusive company culture that encourages creative thinking and collaboration.</p></li><li><p>The opportunity to make a significant impact and bring your creative ideas to life.</p></li><li><p>Interaction with the full Harry's team, fostering strong relationships and collaboration.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Harry’s is committed to bringing together individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives.
