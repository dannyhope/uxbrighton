<h2>Description</h2><p>This is an exciting opportunity for someone who is passionate about interaction design, who’s good at working with people and who cares about making a difference.</p><p>We help our clients design and deliver digital, technology and organisational transformation - solving real problems for real people. We research, design and build things: better services and products, better ways of working, better user experiences and better organisations and culture.<br><br>We work in the public sector, supporting initiatives that improve society and the lives of citizens; with not-for-profit organisations, charities and social enterprises; and with some private-sector companies. The key sectors we're working in at the moment include education, apprenticeships &amp; skills development, social care, rehabilitation, housing and criminal justice - but we're always growing, developing and finding out about new things.</p><p>We’re looking for people with experience of working collaboratively in multi-disciplinary agile teams, ideally with some familiarity of government digital standards (GDS) or an ability to pick this up quickly, good communicators, skilled in using a range of tools and approaches, and who put users at the forefront of their work. Below is an example of some of the things you might do:</p><ul><li><p>Create low and high-fidelity prototypes, using tools such as Figma, Sketch, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://GOV.UK">GOV.UK</a> prototyping kit</p></li><li><p>Analyse and learn from user research to make evidence-based design decisions</p></li><li><p>Map design artefacts such as user flow diagrams to communicate complex user journeys</p></li><li><p>Engage with stakeholders by including them in the design process.</p></li><li><p>Create products and services that are inclusive, easy to use and solve whole problems for real people. These can be both digital and non-digital across different devices, browsers and platforms.</p></li></ul><p>You will work on a range of high-profile digital transformation projects, which could be in a range of sectors including education, training, social care or the criminal justice system. Examples of the projects you could be working on include developing new services to:</p><ul><li><p>Enable people in prison to receive sensitive legal correspondence securely</p></li><li><p>Help local authorities carry on skills assessments on social workers</p></li><li><p>Share sensitive information about children between multiple agencies</p></li><li><p>Support teachers with their professional development</p></li><li><p>Support vulnerable families.</p></li></ul><p>As an interaction designer we’d expect to involve you mainly in alpha or beta stages. You will work with other Farsighters and with our clients in multi-disciplinary teams alongside researchers, analysts, service designers and developers, to design and deliver world-class user-centred services.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><p>You are open, curious, and excited about making a difference during this exciting period of growth. Some of the things we look for include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Experience of working in agile</strong>: You have an awareness of agile tools and approaches, and how to use them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital perspective:</strong> You understand how the digital economy is changing user behaviour and the government landscape.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communicating information:</strong> You can communicate effectively across organisational, technical and political boundaries, understanding the context.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evidence and context-based design: </strong>You can visualise, articulate and solve complex problems and concepts, and make disciplined decisions based on available information and research evidence.</p></li><li><p><strong>User focus:</strong> You understand users and can identify who they are and what their needs are, based on evidence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Community collaboration: </strong>You can contribute to the work of the community, building successful teams through understanding team styles and influencing as well as motivating team members.</p></li></ul><h2>Benefits</h2><p>Our environment is supportive, collaborative and ‘ego-less’. We offer a best in class learning &amp; development programme to help you grow your career. New ideas are encouraged and there’s plenty of opportunities to innovate and make an impact.</p><p>As well as a competitive base salary, you will receive a 5% employer pension contribution, two promotion windows each year, discounted gym membership, Employee Assistance Programme, smart health programme, regular events &amp; parties throughout the year, home working equipment, flexible working model, student loan contributions and enhanced maternity/paternity/adoption pay amongst other things.</p><p><em>This is a UK based role.
