<h2>Company Description</h2><p>We are champions of rail, inspired to build a greener, more sustainable future of travel. Our purpose is our momentum. It makes us feel good because we know we’re doing good. As we lead the way to a greener future, we do it together. We’re all about connections - with each other, with our customers and with the world. Just as our platform brings the world together, it’s our ambition that connects us. We motivate each other to go beyond our limits, to experiment, to fail and to always grow.&nbsp;</p><p>With over 110 million visits every month to our platform and £4.3 billion in net ticket sales, we're always innovating and making moves towards our final destination — a world where travel is as simple, seamless, and affordable as it should be.&nbsp;</p><p>And we couldn't do any of it without our incredible people driving us forward. Today, we're a FTSE 250 company that's proudly home to more than 1000 Trainliners from over 60 nationalities across offices in London, Paris, Barcelona, Milan, Edinburgh, Berlin, Madrid and Brussels. It's this diversity that energises us and makes us stronger, helping us to achieve amazing things.&nbsp;</p><p>With our sights firmly set on further European growth, there is no better time to jump on board this high-speed train and be part of our continued success.&nbsp;</p><h2>Job Description</h2><p>Our design team is bolstering!

You’re bursting at the seams with creativity and ideas; you look through the eyes of users and know how to translate that to designs; you get that design is not just how it looks but how it works; you can talk to all key parts of a design process even if you haven’t lived them; and you can articulate the difference between app and web – knowing what works best on each.</p><p>This is a role for a designer looking for an opportunity to disrupt and define the way we travel, whilst inspiring millions of people worldwide to make more sustainable travel choices.</p><p>Sounds like you? Then read on!</p><p>We turn the fiendishly complex into simple and successful experiences, with award-winning designs. We are the glue between everybody at Trainline.

Consistently.</p></li><li><p>You’ll dive into qual &amp; quant data and find the best opportunities across our product suite, collaborating in workshops to riff on the best solutions and scenarios.</p></li><li><p>You’ll craft exquisite UX designs and get user feedback to prove they work. And you’ll work alongside developers to push our critical features and moments to the next level.</p></li><li><p>You’ll get support to rocket your personal development</p></li></ul><h2>Qualifications</h2><ul><li><p>Around 2 years+ commercial UX Design experience, ideally in a product focused Tech organisation&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You’re great at organising and structuring information in a way that makes sense for our users.</p></li><li><p>You will feel right at home with defining navigation structures, hierarchies, card sorting and labelling, and have great analytical skills.</p></li><li><p>You’re a problem-solver comfortable with complexity and can also find elegant solutions through mock-ups and prototypes.</p></li><li><p>You are familiar with the latest web design trends and IA patterns</p></li><li><p>Comfortable working closely with a team of developers, where you are able to articulate your designs and decisions clearly to support them</p></li><li><p>Figma is your weapon of choice</p></li><li><p>Working knowledge of APIs would be helpful, but not essential!</p></li></ul><p>We appreciate you might not have a wealth of portfolio work, but we do want to see examples of what you can design – even if just concepts of apps/sites. Please share your portfolio when you apply!</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><p>Why should you jump on board?&nbsp;<br><br>We pay special attention to learning and development and organise quarterly company learning days as well as offering a learning budget that can be put towards resources of your choice.

Additionally, we love hosting meetups in our amazing event spaces and having the opportunity to support internal and external community groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We also hold companywide hackathons and our annual Trainline Tech Summit, which provides Trainliners with an opportunity to stand up and share their story, learnings, or new skills with their colleagues in a safe environment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Our flexi-first approach</h3><p>We believe in the importance of a healthy work-life balance and the value of a flexible workforce. Our flexi-first approach outlines our commitment to a hybrid way of working and our expectations of Trainliners. A key part of what makes Trainline special is our people and the value we get from the buzz and energy of our workplaces, and that’s why we’re proud to offer the best of both worlds. In practice this means in–office attendance at least 40% of the time over a 12-week period for all Trainliners. These in-office days are typically team led to help us connect, collaborate and create together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Values&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Think Big </strong>- We're building the future of rail&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Own It </strong>- We care about every customer, partner and journey&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Do Good - </strong>We make a positive impact&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Together </strong>- We're one team&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Interested in finding out more about what it's like to work at Trainline?
