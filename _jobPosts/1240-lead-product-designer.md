<h2 id="about-us">About Us</h2>
<p>Up Learn has built the world’s most effective learning experience. We’ve done this by combining cognitive science, instructional theory and artificial intelligence</p>
<p>Up Learn’s mission is to create the most effective learning experiences in the world, and distribute access to as many students as possible 🙌</p>
<p>Up Learn started with A Levels and developed courses that are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Effective</strong>: 97% of students that complete Up Learn courses achieve an A star/A, starting from grades as low as Ds and Es</li>
<li><strong>Engaging</strong>: 1.6 million hours of learning thanks to Up Learn, and rising</li>
<li><strong>Scaling</strong>: tens of thousands of students use Up Learn today, either independently, or through one of our 300 schools, university or charity partners</li>
</ol>
<p>Up Learn has been growing fast, and is backed by investors that share their vision, including leading venture capital firm Forward Partners and the Branson family (Virgin). Social impact is critical to Up Learn’s mission - for every student that pays, Up Learn gives a full scholarship to a student who can’t. We are growing our incredible, 50+ strong team.</p>
<h2 id="the-role">The Role</h2>
<p>After the first year you will have prepared all aspects of our Product Design for transformation, including atomic design system, strategy, and operations. You will have built the first in-house design team here at Up Learn, and laid the foundations for us to become a design-led company.</p>
<p>In the beginning you will get stuck in personally, embedding in one or more of our squads, interviewing our users and our customers, working with our Product Mangers - as well as our Learning Executives, Engineers, and Data team - to create designs for new features that are a level up; designs that exceed current expectations. You will build on everything we have in place today to produce these quick wins and rapidly build trust and credibility throughout the organisation, while learning first-hand how we got to where we are today.</p>
<p>At the same time, you will be interviewing internal stakeholders, including senior leaders and executives, to build and then articulate a picture of everything that Product Design needs to do over the next two years. This is likely to include a complete UX audit of the current platform (think Built for Mars UX case studies,) brand redesign, rebuilding our atomic design system as needed, hiring our first in-house design team and establishing design operations. We can’t do everything at once, and so you will prioritise this work to produce the highest short-term impact balanced alongside long-term strategic need.</p>
<p>We have built an effective and successful product so far without in-house design expertise. We believe that design now holds the key to our next level of performance, unlocking extraordinary growth potential. Reporting directly to the Chief Education &amp; Product Officer, this is a huge role and a tremendous opportunity for someone with the knowledge and experience to take it on.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="about-you">About You</h3>
<p><strong>If you don’t meet every requirement below, but you still believe you’re the right person for the job, we strongly encourage you to apply.</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a Lead Product Designer who understands that product design is an amalgam of art, mathematics, psychology and empathy. We are looking for a deep thinker and lifelong learner, as well as an adroit practitioner; someone who can exhibit both open-minded creative flare alongside structured and systematic thought. You will fit in well if you’re someone who devours books, articles and podcasts about design, always seeking to learn more and constantly develop.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are experienced enough in planning and executing user research, including usability testing, that these tasks are now facile for you. Your capability here makes you an exemplar for others to learn from, including non-designers</li>
<li>You have a strong focus on UX, but in addition to easily building UX flows and low-fidelity wireframes, you can create highly polished pixel-perfect designs if needed</li>
<li>You have experience in building a Product Design function, establishing processes and best practice, and developing junior designers</li>
<li>Excellent communication skills are a must. You must be able to structure your thoughts and communicate what you have learned about our users and what you are thinking about what we should do next, and why, to people throughout the company, including non-designers and people outside of the Product function</li>
<li>You know how to prioritise more work that you have time for, balancing multiple projects against competing demands</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, please be sure that you are comfortable with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working in a startup environment, where things can change fast and you might be asked to catch up quickly</li>
<li>A culture of personal and professional development and feedback - ideally this is an environment in which you thrive</li>
<li>Above all, you care deeply about Up Learn's mission to solve education and improve students' lives</li>
<li>At Up Learn, we welcome everyone and are committed to building inclusive teams. We celebrate differences and encourage everyone to join us and be themselves at work. We always follow the guidelines of the Equality Act in all aspects of recruitment, selection, employment, training, development and promotion opportunities at Up Learn.</li>
