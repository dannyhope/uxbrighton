<p><strong>This role in 3 words:</strong> Innovative, Collaborative, Challenging</p><p><strong>Top 3 qualities for this role:</strong> Creativity, Communication, Adaptability</p><p><strong>In the words of the team, you should leave your current role for this one because….</strong></p><p><em>This is an opportunity to define the experiences that enable EV charging in the future</em></p><h2>Where you'll work</h2><p>At OVO, we understand that a one size fits all approach doesn't work for everyone. That's why we created the OVO Way of Flexibility.</p><p>All our roles are hub based (Bristol, Glasgow or London), providing a dedicated space for collaboration, connection and teamwork. You'll also have the flexibility to work from home.</p><h2>Everyone belongs at OVO</h2><p>At OVO, we are on a mission to solve one of humanity's biggest challenges, the climate crisis. And we know it takes all of us to change the world. That's why we need diverse people from all abilities, gender identities, ethnicities, ages, sexual orientations, life experiences and backgrounds to join us.</p><h2>Teamworking for the planet</h2><p>Everything we do here spins around Plan Zero. So, naturally, the team you'll be joining plays a gigantic role in making that happen. Here's how:</p><p>We've made good progress on the UK's path to net zero. But we can do better. Research shows that 100% renewable energy tariffs aren't actually making the grid greener. We have to go further. We need to save energy, use power at smarter times of the day and look at other ways to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>That's where OVO Drive comes in, it's our dedicated electric vehicle business. We already provide hardware installations, home &amp; public charging, but we want so much more, we want to build a single app experience that covers everything an EV driver could need this role will play a huge part in that.</p><p>We work like a start up- using our entrepreneurial, OVO Way spirit to drive us forward. And we'll be flexible about how we do it - trying new things, growing the ones that work and learning new, green skills as we go.</p><h2>This role in a nutshell</h2><p>Sitting in the OVO Drive business this role will bring the ideas of the team to life, and move the array of OVO's EV products to the next stage. This includes ideating and designing new features and products, optimising the UX and UI to maximise performance and combining Home and Public charging experience to build one of a kind experience in the EV industry.</p><h2>Your key outcomes will be</h2><ul><li><p>Create high-quality design outputs including concepts, user journeys, wireframes, UI flows, and detailed UI designs across IOS, Android and web platforms.</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with design team members and other partners to identify new opportunities and design solutions that bring value for both our B2C and B2B customers. Present clearly design concepts and communicate your work to team members and partners to ensure alignment and understanding. Plan independently, facilitate, and implement research activities, with the support of the design and research teams when necessary. Develop interactive prototypes and conduct usability research to iterate and refine designs. Work closely with engineering and product development teams to ensure the successful delivery of the final product. Proactively contribute to and maintain design systems across all platforms (B2C and B2B), ensuring consistency across all results. Estimate accurately and plan your workload, assisting with prioritisation to manage deadlines effectively.</p></li><li><p>…probably many more things we can't even predict at this point.</p></li></ul><h2>You'll be a successful Product Designer at OVO if you…</h2><ul><li><p>Possess at least 3 years of proven experience as a Mid-Senior Product Designer in an end-to-end role, owning projects throughout their entire lifecycle—from conception and ideation to delivery.</p></li><li><p>Handle and prioritise your time and projects autonomously – comfortable to define and drive the vision for your work, even when navigating some ambiguity. Demonstrate proven experience in UX and UI design, showcasing impactful research and clear outcomes that have significantly improved both user experience and business objectives.</p></li><li><p>Experience working across a variety of digital platforms—including mobile (iOS and Android) and web—is crucial. Demonstrating expertise with B2C products is required, with additional experience in B2B considered a significant plus. Systems thinking and ability to implement established best practices and patterns to deliver outputs of high standards and accessible, inclusive experiences.</p></li><li><p>Ability to collaborate effectively within small, multidisciplinary teams, integrating diverse perspectives to achieve project goals.</p></li></ul><h2>Let's talk about what's in it for you</h2><p>We'll pay you between £58,000 - £70,400, depending on your specific skills and experience. If your expectations are a little different, have a chat with us!</p><p>We keep our pay ranges broad on purpose to give us, and you, flexibility to match your experience to our zero carbon mission.</p><p>You'll be eligible for an on-target bonus of 15%. We have one OVO bonus plan that focuses on the collective performance of our people to deliver our Plan Zero goal.</p><p>We also offer plenty of green benefits and progressive policies to help you feel like you belong at OVO…and there's flex pay. It's an extra 9% of your salary on top of your core pay to use as you like. You can take it as cash, add to your pension, or choose to spend it on a huge range of flex benefits. <br><br>Here's a taster of what's on offer:</p><p>For starters, you'll get 34 days of holiday (including bank holidays). <br><br><strong>For your health</strong><br>With benefits like a healthcare cash plan or private medical insurance depending on your career level, critical illness cover, life assurance, health assessments, and more<br><br><strong>For your wellbeing</strong><br>With gym membership, gadget, travel and cyber insurance, workplace ISA, will writing services, DNA testing, dental insurance, and more <br><br><strong>For your lifestyle </strong><br>With extra holiday buying, discount dining, culture cards, tech loans, and supporting your favourite charities with give-as-you-earn donations<br><br><strong>For your home </strong><br>Get up to £300 off any OVO Energy plan (when you pay by Direct Debit), plus personal carbon offsetting and great discounts on smart thermostats and EV chargers<br><br><strong>For your commute </strong><br>Nab a great deal on ultra-low emission car leasing<strong>, </strong>plus our cycle to work scheme and public transport season ticket loans <br><br>Want to hear about our full range of flexible benefits and progressive people policies? Our People Team can tell you everything you need to know.</p><p><strong>For your Belonging</strong></p><p>To find better ways to support our people, we need to listen to each other's experiences and find ways to build a truly inclusive and diverse workplace. As part of this, we have 8 Belonging Networks at OVO. Led by our people, for our people - so when you join OVO, you can play a part - big or small - with any of the Networks. It's up to you.</p><p><strong>Oh, and one last thing...</strong></p><p>We'd be thrilled if you tick off all our boxes yet we also believe it's just as important we tick off all of yours. And if you think you have most of what we're looking for but not every single thing, go ahead and hit <strong>apply</strong>. We'd still love to hear from you! If you have any additional requirements, there's a space to let us know on the application form; we want to make the process as easy and comfortable for you as possible..</p>
