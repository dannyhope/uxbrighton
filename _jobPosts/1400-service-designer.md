<h2>About&nbsp;Us&nbsp;</h2><p>Help Musicians is a&nbsp;charity that loves music and for over 100&nbsp;years has been working hard to make a&nbsp;meaningful difference to the lives of musicians across the UK. We want to create a&nbsp;world where musicians thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>A musician’s life can be precarious with ups and downs throughout a&nbsp;career. Opportunities must be hard-won, whilst challenges come along all too easily, with unsteady income and physical and mental health concerns common issues to navigate. In addition, training can take many years and, along with investing in instruments and other equipment, puts up financial barriers to creative progression. Help Musicians offers a&nbsp;broad range of help to support music creators in times of crisis and opportunity — ensuring musicians across the UK can achieve their potential and sustain a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;music.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, right now, musicians need our help more than ever with research in 2020 showing that over half believe they may need to leave the industry due to multiple career pressures.
