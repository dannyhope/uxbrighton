<h2>About us</h2><p>We‚Äôre here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.</p><p>We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.</p><p>We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.<br></p><h2>About our Product Design Team</h2><p>Read through our blog to get an insight into the team and how it works. Our director, Vuokko has given a number of talks about Monzo which you can find here:<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://monzo.com/design/">https://monzo.com/design/</a></p><h2>What you‚Äôll be working on</h2><ul><li><p>Core banking features for Monzo's iPhone and Android apps. Increasing visibility and control of money across multiple accounts: we want Monzo to be the financial hub of your life, and something this ambitious requires a lot of good design.</p></li></ul><h2>Your day-to-day<br></h2><ul><li><p>You‚Äôll lead design for a product area. This includes driving the future vision of this area, making sure it compliments a cohesive overall Monzo experience, and delivering on incremental steps to help the team head in this direction.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôll be embedded in a cross-functional product squad. You‚Äôll be responsible for all design artefacts produced; from initial discovery and user journey mapping through to the execution of final UI design details.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôll deeply understand the customers you‚Äôre designing for. Whether it‚Äôs joining user research sessions, learning from previous insights, reading data reports or running your own lightweight research and analysis, you‚Äôll strive to understand the what, why and how of the problems you‚Äôre solving for to ensure we don‚Äôt just ship the thing right, but we ship the <em>right</em> thing.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôll collaborate regularly using strong communication, documentation and facilitation skills. You‚Äôll work closely with PMs, Engineers, Data scientists, User researchers and writers to make sure your team isn‚Äôt just shipping great designs, but they are deeply involved throughout the design process.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôll execute (and advocate for) polished, intuitive and accessible user experiences. You‚Äôre pragmatic and able to balance the ideal experience with knowing where and when to make scoping trade-offs based on technical constraints, experimentation strategy or business risk.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôll help raise the bar for design at Monzo. We‚Äôre a small but mighty team where every designer plays a critical role in improving our community of practice‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through improving our craft skills to leading rituals to giving great feedback.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôll regularly work with a design director and product leadership. This is to help make sure long-term strategy, business goals and experience quality are all in alignment and that there are healthy opportunities for visibility and feedback.</p></li></ul><h2>You should apply if</h2><ul><li><p>You‚Äôve led the design of world-class product launches in a fast-growing company before.</p></li><li><p>You understand that good design is not about trends but is built on top of principles and tradeoffs. You make well-reasoned design decisions always advocating for the best possible user experience.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôre passionate about inclusive design and accessibility, and you‚Äôll design with all our users in mind.</p></li><li><p>You care about the UI design details but are also comfortable zooming out, seeing the broader picture and connecting the dots to create a cohesive overall experience.</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôre familiar with native mobile design patterns on Android and iOS and have designed polished apps for both platforms</p></li><li><p>You‚Äôre passionate about sharing your knowledge, and raising the bar for design practice at Monzo. Previous experience mentoring designers is a big plus.</p></li><li><p>You understand that writing is designing, you're a confident writer, and the copy in your screens is never an afterthought.<br></p></li></ul><h2>The Interview Process</h2><p>Our interview process involves 3 main stages:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Initial call (30 minutes). A video chat with Natalie who is part of our hiring team.&nbsp; This focuses on general suitability and fit for Monzo.</p></li><li><p>Portfolio Walk-through (45 minutes+). We'll ask you to prepare a couple of projects which demonstrates your end-to-end design process and deliverables. You will go through this with our Design Director Or Principal Designer and another designer in the team where they will ask follow up questions, digging deeper into your process and work.</p></li><li><p>Final round (3 hours). This involves three interviews covering craft, impact and teamwork. These typically happen on the same day via three separate video calls. The portfolio submitted is used as a reference for these interviews to help set context for us, and save you time repeating yourself.</p></li></ul><p>Our average process takes around 2-3 weeks but we will always work around your availability.
