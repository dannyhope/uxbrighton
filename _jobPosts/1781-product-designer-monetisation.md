<p>This is an exciting opportunity to join a fast-paced and dynamic tech company. Picsart is the world's #1 creative platform and social editing app with a huge 150+ million monthly active users and an install base of more than 1 billion.</p><p>At Picsart, we prioritise our creators and firmly believe that an exceptional creator experience is the cornerstone of our success. The Design disciplines of Product Design, User Research and UX Writing are instrumental in shaping and crafting these experiences and defining what the future of Picsart could look like.&nbsp;</p><p>Product Designers at Picsart are the driving engine behind delivering a best-in-class experience. We work embedded in teams, alongside Product and Engineers, partnering with User Researchers, UX Writers and Data Scientists at a business unit level. This is a fast-paced work environment, so attentiveness, a strong sense of autonomy and the ability to handle multiple projects with ease are a must.&nbsp;</p><p>This role would be supporting the Monetization team, within the Growth business unit. This role has a large surface area spanning web and mobile, and provides the opportunity to work closely with the other teams inside and outside Growth. The role would suit an established Product Designer who loves creating consistent experiences and wants to develop their systems thinking.</p><h2>By joining us, you will benefit from</h2><ul><li><p>An honest, open culture that emphasises feedback and promotes professional and personal development.</p></li><li><p>Hybrid setup— our team is distributed worldwide, from Armenia to US, UK, Germany, Spain and Romania.</p></li><li><p>Different wellbeing benefits (including a monthly wellbeing fund).</p></li><li><p>Growing opportunities — based on your preference you can grow in the company as a people manager or as an individual contributor.</p></li><li><p>An environment that fosters innovation and creativity, a culture with the ability to pilot new trends</p></li></ul><h2>You will</h2><ul><li><p>Own user-centred product design for the Monetization team, including all the upgrade and upsell touchpoints, the premium user experience, free trial conversion, subscriber loyalty and winback flows across mobile and web</p><ul><li><p>Encourage users to sign up to the free trial and upgrade to a Picsart subscription&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Define how and when we communicate to the user that they’re approaching their AI Generation tool usage limits, and encourage them to upgrade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Work closely with your product manager and engineers to define requirements and deliver experiences that have business impact</p></li><li><p>Run workshops to source ideas and insight with various peer groups to create momentum and direction</p></li><li><p>Balance business and user needs</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Share your designs at various stages for feedback and iteration</p><ul><li><p>Create wireframes, prototypes, and interactive mockups to visualise and communicate your design ideas effectively. We use Figma in case you’re wondering</p></li><li><p>Share often and early, to get input from your immediate team, your discipline and the wider business</p></li><li><p>Collaborate and leverage the skills of our design system and creative teams to shape and maintain a consistent and on-brand experience</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Get intimately familiar with the user and the business</p><ul><li><p>Immerse yourself in the reams of research and data reports, and deeply understand our users and target audience inside and outside the Picsart experience</p></li><li><p>Work closely with your research partner, being an active observer in user research sessions and highlighting possible new questions to answer about our target audience to inform your work</p></li><li><p>Plan and run your own low-risk lightweight usability testing to evaluate your design solutions (with help from your research partner)&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Contribute towards design team culture&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Generously share your knowledge and experience by regularly presenting in the monthly Design Town Hall&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Implement changes that you think would improve our ways of working and highlight suggestions for making changes</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>About you</h2><ul><li><p>You have 3+ years of experience as a User Experience Designer or Product Designer, or equivalent.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You enjoy thinking in systems and are obsessed with consistency. You’ve read Apple, Google’s and other big tech widely published interface and material design guidelines and have worked with design systems previously.</p></li><li><p>You’re comfortable designing for both mobile and web.&nbsp;You’ll be working across both platforms.</p></li><li><p>You’ve done some journey mapping before, or have an appetite to do it. In one of your first projects you’ll be thinking about the logic and triggers behind usage limits – you’ll need to do some mapping.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You’re a proactive partner. You consider yourself a go-getter and have a bias to action. You enjoy working at pace and with other people, like engineers, data analysts, brand designers and product managers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You’ve got an eye for detail, and hold yourself to high standards. You care about the subtle interactions that create moments of delight for users.</p></li><li><p>Your design work is evidence-based.&nbsp;You’re comfortable providing clear rationale and logical reasoning for your design decisions based on desk and user research, data, business needs and market insight, and intuition.</p></li><li><p>You tend to over-communicate, and have strong written and verbal skills. Our team is distributed globally and you’ll be working with a team that’s mostly remote, so clarity is key.</p></li><li><p>You’re curious and have a growth mindset. You can embrace change and learn from challenges. You reflect on events and improve.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You’re adaptable and resilient. We’re a scale-up with ambitious plans, and priorities often evolve. We want team members who are committed to our mission and want to contribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>This job isn't for you if</h2><ul><li><p>You want to design by committee. Although you’ll have plenty of forums and people to source feedback from, you’ll be expected to form an opinion when it comes to the approach you think we should take, through your designs. The role offers a huge amount of autonomy and it’s up to you to make the most of it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You want to design in a bubble and don’t enjoy presenting your work and taking on feedback. To be successful, you’ll need to share early and source often from a wide stakeholder group, to gather input from peers within and across other business units.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You like to work on a single thing at a time for months on end. Things move quickly at Picsart, and you might be working on exploration for one project while working with engineering on grooming another.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You want to follow a predictable design process every time. We take a fluid and flexible approach to each problem, and often ship to learn.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You want to design visuals and graphics. You’ll be working closely with the creative team to input on creative direction and while you might have the occasional opportunity to do this, your focus will primarily be on the user experience rather than the expression of the visual identity.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>This is a hybrid role, and our office is based in Shoreditch.</p><p>#LI-MB1&nbsp;</p>
