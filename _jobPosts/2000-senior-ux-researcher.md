<h2>Why should I Apply</h2><p>At Sonar, we’re a group of brilliant, motivated, and driven professionals working hard to help organizations build responsible, secure, high-quality code quickly and systematically. We build solutions that don’t just solve symptoms of problems – we fix problems at the source – source code, to be specific.</p><p>We have a dynamic culture with employees worldwide and hub offices in the USA, Switzerland, France, the UK, Singapore, and Germany. We believe team members should have the opportunity to come to work every day, work on a product they are proud of, love what they do, and feel energized by their peers. With our roots deep in the open source community, we’re all about the mission: provide solutions that deliver Clean Code.</p><h2>The impact you will have</h2><p>Ask a friend or colleague developer about Sonar or SonarQube. They have heard from us and will likely use the products. This is how significant our impact on the tech industry is.</p><p>The UX craft has been gradually evolving at Sonar, and there is still much to do. In 2023, UX benchmarked a solid stage 3 of the NNG maturity model at Sonar, with a strong appetite to evolve from there in the next few years. We hold ourselves to high standards, and we are looking for invested, resilient, and humble professionals to join us for the journey ahead.</p><p>You know the nuances of Research, deliver with predictable cadency and you are making your first steps to coach others. You lead on specific topics, adopt standards and proactively raise topics. You will present solutions to problems and use your own creativity to find solutions. You will manage expectations clearly and set an example through your actions. You are expected to think proactively across the team and also engage colleagues outside the team when needed. You are flexible over fixed, collaborative over withdrawn, and willing to go the extra mile. You are expected to influence the overall agenda and definition of the working framework.</p><p>You will work in a tech-heavy environment with Engineers, UX Designers and Product &lt;anagers. You embrace and navigate the complexity of software development, dealing with terminology and taxonomy likely beyond anything you have ever faced, and be expected to deliver product experiences to one of the most knowledgeable, pragmatic, and engaged crafts in the digital space besides your software engineers.</p><h2>On a daily basis, you will</h2><ul><li><p>Identify new potential problems for users by <strong>autonomously driving user-related problem discovery</strong> and pairing with product managers to support business-related problem discovery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomously drive studies that generate insights</strong> into the business or user problems we are attempting to solve, helping frame these problems and how much they affect the user or customer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drive or support solution discovery stages</strong> in product development to map possible solutions and constraints and prepare the best options for users that engineering can build.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support the solution design stage</strong> ​​by evaluating candidate solutions, by picking suitable methods within given constraints.</p></li><li><p>Assess a feature once it is released into the wild, measuring its impact and success compared to what was initially&nbsp;planned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Participate and support</strong> Product managers in breaking down objectives into feasible, valuable, and timely delivery plans and roadmaps and providing insights to prioritize product opportunities.</p></li></ul><h2>The technical skills you demonstrate</h2><ul><li><p>Quantitative Research</p></li><li><p>Qualitative Research</p></li><li><p>Information Architecture</p></li><li><p>Group facilitation</p></li><li><p>Interaction design</p></li><li><p>Systems thinking</p></li><li><p>Prototyping</p></li></ul><h2>The soft skills you demonstrate</h2><ul><li><p>Communication</p></li><li><p>Critical Thinking</p></li><li><p>Curiosity</p></li><li><p>Adaptability</p></li><li><p>Empathy</p></li><li><p>Growth mindset</p></li><li><p>Planning</p></li><li><p>Negotiation</p></li></ul><p>We will also expect a solid level of business-oriented competencies, such as constraint management and the understanding of the business impact of your actions or decisions.</p><p>We value diverse talents and encourage you to apply even if your skills differ from those listed.</p><h2>Why you will love it here</h2><ul><li><p>Our culture and mission set us apart. We have a dynamic work culture that values respect and kindness – and embraces the right to fail (and get right back up again!). We believe that the best idea wins and everyone has a voice.</p></li><li><p>We believe that great people make a great company. We value people skills as much as technical skills and strive to keep things friendly and laid-back while still being passionate leaders in our domains. Our 550+ SonarSourcers from 33 different nationalities can relate!</p></li><li><p>We embrace work-life balance. It is important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This is why we have a flexible work policy that includes remote and in-office hybrid work.</p></li><li><p>We have a growth mindset. We love to learn and believe that continuous education is critical to our success. In an ever-changing industry, new skills are a must, and we're happy to help our team acquire them.</p></li></ul><h2>We prioritize Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2><p>At Sonar, we are a global workforce and recognize the value of different backgrounds, and global cultures.</p><p>We are committed to creating a diverse work environment and are proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.</p><p><em>All offers of employment at Sonar are contingent upon the clear results of a comprehensive background check conducted prior to the start date.</em></p>
