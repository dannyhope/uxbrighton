<h2 id="we-seek-a-creative-digital-designer-inspired-by-innovation-and-creative-thinking">We seek a creative digital designer inspired by innovation and creative thinking</h2>
<p>Signifly is one of the fastest-growing agencies in Denmark, with global hubs in the Nordics and Canada. Our ambitious and energetic team has won several awards for our innovative approach to digital products and user experiences. We are a young team constantly pushing the limits of our work and capabilities.</p>
<p>In April 2023, we opened our first office in the UK, and we are now looking for a creative digital designer to join our UK start-up journey. You will be the first designer we hire and will therefore be able to put your mark on our first digital and creative projects. You will also work closely with our 15+ designers in Copenhagen and Montreal and contribute to our global projects. </p>
<p>You can expect to be working on digital projects for customers ranging from start-ups to large enterprises with one overall objective – to help them unleash their digital potential through excellent user experiences in everything from apps, websites, e-commerce, and digital campaigns.</p>
<p>Hence, you need a deep business understanding and the ability to find essential insights through design-thinking workshops, user research, testing, and prototyping. As a digital designer, you will also get to work on visual identity projects, so experience within branding is a plus.</p>
<p>At Signifly, we are a team, so besides working with the rest of the design team, you will also be working with developers and strategists to understand technical requirements and business objectives as they relate to the design of the products.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-expect-from-you">What we expect from you</h2>
<p>You are a super-user of Figma (we use that), Sketch, or Adobe XD, and you know your way around the Adobe Suite. You are familiar with creating digital designs and prototypes with tools such as Figma, Marvel, InVision, or Principle.</p>
<p>Specific requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a kick-ass portfolio of digital design projects</li>
<li>You excel in creating digital experiences and interfaces using the latest design software</li>
<li>You have experience with the design process and have a passion for bringing concepts to life through design</li>
<li>You are passionate about strategic design and branding</li>
<li>You are good at understanding user- and client problems and can propose intelligent design solutions to address them</li>
<li>You can present your ideas and designs to clients and participate in client meetings</li>
<li>You have a strong interest in and knowledge of UI, UX, technology, and digital products</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional creative skills within Visual Identity design, Animation, UX processes, Photography, E-commerce, Prototyping, Illustration, Concept development, CSS, Javascript, or Copywriting are always cool - we love to play around with all things within creative and tech.</p>
<h2 id="please-expect-from-us">Please expect from us</h2>
<p><strong>The most important thing</strong> that we offer is an inspiring and ambitious work environment, with an emphasis on learning and developing, both personally and as a team. We have an informal organisation with minimal hierarchy, where there is plenty of room for being ambitious within your area of expertise and taking part in shaping our team, culture, and product offering.</p>
<p><strong>But, of course, we can also tempt you with the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yearly one-week team trip with both social and professional focuses (paid). This year, we’re off to Portugal.</li>
<li>For now, we’re working from WeWork on an all-access membership with access to hot desks, private phone booths, and lounges. There’s free barista coffee, tea, and beers on tap. We plan on getting a dedicated office within the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Paid equipment of high quality - you choose what you prefer</li>
<li>Inspiration trips to events, meet-ups, and conferences</li>
<li>Competitive salary based on qualifications and performance</li>
<li>Career progress based on merits rather than seniority</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you think something needs to be added, let us know. We can probably work together to add it. After all, we are trying to create the best possible place to work!</p>
<h2 id="want-to-work-with-us">Want to work with us?</h2>
<p>Then don’t hesitate to send us your application, CV, and portfolio as soon as possible. Applications are reviewed continuously as we receive them, and we hire when we find the right candidate. For more information or questions, please contact Kathrine Boysen (Brand Strategist, UK) at <a href="mailto:keb@signifly.com">keb@signifly.com</a>.</p>
