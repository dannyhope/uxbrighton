<p>As a Barclays Scale Capability Learner UX &amp; Designer, you will join the HR Development Design team, being accountable for the User Experience and Content design. This is an exciting opportunity for you to manage the development and measurement of learning solutions and programmes that assist with the consistently excellent programme of work, in line with Barclays defined quality standards including Brand and Accessibility.</p>
<p>Barclays is one of the world's largest and most respected financial institutions, with 329 years of success, quality, and innovation behind us. We offer careers that provide endless opportunity – helping millions of individuals and businesses thrive and creating financial and digital solutions that the world now takes for granted.</p>
<p>We are currently in the early stages of implementing a hybrid working environment, which means that many colleagues spend part of their working hours at home and part in the office, depending on the nature of the role they are in. We’re flexible on how this works and it may continue to change and evolve. Depending on your team, typically this means that colleagues spend a minimum of between 20% to 60% of their time in the office, which could be over a week, a month or a quarter. However, some colleagues may choose to spend more time in the office over a typical period than their role type requires. We also have a flexible working process where, subject to business needs, all colleagues globally are able to request work patterns to reflect their personal circumstances. Please discuss the detail of the working pattern options for the role with the hiring manager.</p>
