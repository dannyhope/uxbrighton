We‚Äôre a funded scale-up on a mission to impact more lives than any other fitness company, and build a healthier world for everyone.</p><p>We started life in 2016 in a garden shed in the UK. Today, we‚Äôre building FitXR, one of the top-downloaded apps on the Meta Quest store. We‚Äôve raised close to $40m from top investors such as Maveron, Hiro, BoostVC and TriplePoint.</p><p>We‚Äôre a remote-first team of just under 100 people from across the US, UK, and Spain, and we‚Äôre committed to making it simpler and more enjoyable for people to get moving. We believe that anybody can fall in love with fitness and make movement part of their life.</p><p>Our team is distributed across Europe and the US. We‚Äôre guided by our Principles of Play: eight core beliefs about how we treat each other and our community. We make space for every voice, believe in the importance of a learner‚Äôs mindset, and prioritize team success over individual glory.</p><p>The FitXR app contains a growing range of fitness studios, where members can choose from box workouts with world-class trainers like Olympian Nicola Adams, powerful HIIT workouts, and immersive dance classes.
