<h2>About Us</h2><p>This is an exciting time within the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry (FMD). We have recently launched our new Digital Education Studio (DES), a centre of excellence where experts of digital education, will work together with teaching teams and students to co-design and advance digital learning and teaching practices.</p><p>The DES will be pivotal in establishing a new model for designing digital learning courses of consistent high quality and for a community of practice that will ensure the Faculty’s programmes continue to open the doors of opportunity to a Queen Mary University of London education.</p><p>For information on our vision, including that of our Dean for Digital Education, Professor Chie Adachi, visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/fmd/jobs/digital-education-studio/">our website</a>.</p><p>To support the next stages of our ambitious plans, we are looking to appoint a <strong>UX Designer</strong>.</p><h2>About The Role</h2><p>This pivotal role will provide you with the opportunity to support the growth and transformation of digital education in FMD. You will be critical in designing and developing the user/student-centred design thinking approaches, and ensure that user experiences are embedded into all stages of the re-design process for digital learning courses – from initial student experience mapping informing redesigns, to content development in collaboration with academic and professional staff, and academic staff capacity building activities.</p><p>Current digital innovation projects include the design and development of new Postgraduate programmes, spanning from Medical Education to Robotic Surgery. Working across the Faculty, this role offers you the chance to shape the future of digital education within the FMD, supporting the impact digital education can have on the workforce of the future.</p><h2>About You</h2><p>Within Queen Mary University of London, we actively welcome diversity of ideas, thought and background. For this reason, while an understanding of the Digital Education industry would be beneficial, it is not essential that you come from a Higher Education background.</p><p>What we want is a passion for delivering transformation, creativity in thought and a desire to use your expertise in UX Design to help shape our ambitious plans but who can keep core education / learning principles front of mind throughout.</p><p>You are likely to have worked at a similar level and might see our role as the ideal opportunity to add to your current portfolio and deliver real change. Alternatively, you might have been part of a much larger team and might see our role as your opportunity to have overall accountability for delivery, seeing your work actively contribute to part of a holistic digital learning experience for our students.</p><p>Whatever your motivations for applying, you will be an individual who enjoys problem solving, or coming up with unique approaches to presenting interactive content (in our case educational).</p><p>You will have the ability to understand and then develop and fine tune the experience of our student’s relationship with our digital learning courses. Through your previous exposure to working on the functionality of internal systems, you will recognise the importance of the thread of accessibility, engagement, enrichment, stimulation, and user-friendliness in all that you create and deliver.</p><h2>Further Information</h2><p>Closes: Sunday 24th September 2023</p><p>Shortlisting: w/c 25th September 2023</p><p>Interviews (likely in person) either Thursday 5th, Friday 6th or Monday 9th October 2023</p><p>For more information on the benefits we offer, our commitment to candidates and the job pack, please hit the apply button.</p>
