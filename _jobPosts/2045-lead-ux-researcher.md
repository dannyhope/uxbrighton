<p>Ready to revolutionize healthcare, making it faster and more accessible than ever before?&nbsp;</p><h2>How we started</h2><p>Back in 2013, our founder Dwayne D’Souza saw an opportunity to give people faster and more convenient access to medications using technology.

Our 2023 global revenue was $80m, and we’re set to more than double this in 2024 as we look to surpass $200m and positively impact the daily lives of more people than ever before. <strong>There’s never been a more exciting time to join HeliosX.</strong></p><h2>Where we’re going</h2><p>Over the next five years, you’ll support our goal to become a world-leading healthcare partner, deepening our customer relationships, expanding into new countries, and diversifying our product portfolio to treat more conditions.
