<h2>Description</h2><p>This is an exciting opportunity to join a fast-paced and dynamic tech company. Picsart is the world's #1 creative platform and social editing app with a huge 150+ million monthly active users and an install base of more than 1 billion.</p><p>Picsart is a leading global tech company driving innovation at the intersection of creativity and artificial intelligence.

The Design disciplines of Product Design, User Research and UX Writing are instrumental in shaping and crafting these experiences and defining what the future of Picsart could look like.&nbsp;</p><p>Product Designers at Picsart are the driving engine behind delivering a best-in-class experience. We work embedded in teams, alongside Product and Engineers, partnering with User Researchers, UX Writers and Data Scientists at a business unit level. This is a fast-paced work environment, so attentiveness, a strong sense of autonomy and the ability to handle multiple projects with ease are a must.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve recently undergone a restructure in the Growth business unit, and the Engagement team has recently been formed. This role has a large surface area spanning web and mobile, and provides the opportunity to work closely with the Acquisition, Activation and Monetization teams. The role would suit a strong senior looking to step up and develop their leadership capabilities, or someone who is already a confident design lead looking for a new juicy challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>By joining us, you will benefit from</h2><ul><li><p>An honest, open culture that emphasises feedback and promotes professional and personal development.</p></li><li><p>Hybrid setup— our team is distributed worldwide, from Armenia to US, UK, Germany, Spain and Romania.</p></li><li><p>Different wellbeing benefits (including a monthly wellbeing fund).</p></li><li><p>Growing opportunities — based on your preference you can grow in the company as a people manager or as an individual contributor.</p></li><li><p>An environment that fosters innovation and creativity, a culture with the ability to pilot new trends</p></li></ul><h2>You will</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Lead user-centred product design for the Engagement team (and beyond)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Define and bring to life the future of the ongoing user experience for Picsart users, to encourage return visits and repeat usage&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Work closely with your product manager and engineers to define requirements and deliver experiences that have business impact</p></li><li><p>Run workshops to source ideas and insight with various peer groups to create momentum and direction</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Share your designs at various stages for feedback and iteration&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Create wireframes, prototypes, and interactive mockups to visualise and communicate your design ideas effectively. We use Figma in case you’re wondering&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Share often and early, to get input from your immediate team, your discipline and the wider business.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Collaborate and leverage the skills of our design system and creative teams to shape and maintain a consistent and on-brand experience</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Get intimately familiar with the user and the business</strong></p><ul><li><p>Immerse yourself in the reams of research and data reports, and deeply understand our users and target audience inside and outside the Picsart experience&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Work closely with your research partner, being an active observer in user research sessions and highlighting possible new questions to answer about our target audience to inform your work&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Plan and run your own low-risk lightweight usability testing to evaluate your design solutions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Contribute towards design team culture&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Provide guidance and support to more junior designers through mentorship, fostering a culture of design excellence in the team</p></li><li><p>Part of the Design Council, which includes senior ICs in Design and design leadership (management)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Generously share your knowledge and experience by regularly presenting in the monthly Design Town Hall</p></li><li><p>Implement changes and own rituals that you think would improve our ways of working and create some fun in the team&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>About you</h2><ul><li><p>You have 5+ years of experience as a User Experience Designer or Product Designer, or equivalent.</p></li><li><p><strong>You have a proven track record</strong> of leading end-to-end design projects, where you imagined and delivered entirely new experiences and successfully shipped web and mobile products that solved real problems for real people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>You’re a proactive partner.</strong> You consider yourself a go-getter and have a bias toward action. You’re used to working at pace, and leveraging other functions’ expertise to deliver a high quality finish.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>You have strong visual design and interaction design skills</strong>, and hold yourself to high standards. You’ve worked with design systems to produce beautiful and functional design that scales</p></li><li><p><strong>Your designs are evidence-based, </strong>balancing user and business needs<strong>. </strong>You’re comfortable providing clear rationale and logical reasoning for your design decisions based on research, data, business and market insight, and intuition.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>You thrive in ambiguity</strong>.
