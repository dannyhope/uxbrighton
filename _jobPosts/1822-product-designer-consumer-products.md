Since then, we’ve seen incredible growth as a scaling fintech, welcoming over 150,000 customers and growing the Dojo team to 1,000+ people across five locations. In that time, we’ve also introduced Dojo Virtual Queues &amp; Bookings and the Dojo restaurant finder app, formerly known as WalkUp and loved by 1,000 restaurants and 750,000 diners.</p><p>Today, we work towards our mission to empower businesses to thrive in the Experience Economy by creating the tools and technology that turn transactions into meaningful relationships. For our business customers, that means fast funding, the fastest payments, smart integrations, and efficient virtual queues &amp; bookings - all with instant insight across the board. For diners, that means getting seated at their favourite restaurants with just a couple of taps on the Dojo app. Whether it’s for busy business owners or hungry diners, every Dojo product is built to address real customer pain points by our dedicated teams in London, Bristol, Hull and Belfast.</p><h2>Our values</h2><p>At Dojo, we’re curious. We have an insatiable desire to learn and innovate. And we’re relentless. We persevere even when it’s easier not to. But, we’re nothing without our customers, who drive everything we do. From day one, Dojo was built on real customer pain points and every one of us is customer-obsessed.</p><h2>Our way of working</h2><p>Dojo has adopted a set of shared principles with the aim of increasing in-person collaboration and amplifying our ‘Customer First’ values. We encourage our employees to meet in-person over virtual meetings, and our communication is mostly asynchronous. Unlike most other businesses, we are intentionally avoiding a rules-based approach, and each team is empowered to make the arrangements that work best for their success. The answer to every scenario which tests these principles is: We trust you to use your judgement responsibly, in the best interest of our customers.</p><p>Find out more about our benefits and what it’s like to work at Dojo at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://dojo.careers">dojo.careers</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.dojo.careers/">&nbsp;</a>.&nbsp;Learn more about Life at Dojo on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dojo-tech/mycompany/">LinkedIn&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.instagram.com/dojo.careers/">Instagram.</a></p><p>Refer to our&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.dojo.careers/privacy-notice/">Data Privacy Statement for Candidates</a>&nbsp;for details on our data handling practices during your application.</p>
