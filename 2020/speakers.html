              <li>You will present from your own laptop</li>
              <li>You will need to bring your laptop and monitor adaptors - don’t forget your charger too!</li>
              <li>There will be Wifi at the venue, however we would suggest that you don’t rely on accessing the internet for your presentation.</li>
              <li>You can embed audio within your slides if necessary.</li>

              <li>We don’t require your decks beforehand, however we do like to make them available to delegates after the event.
              </li>

            <h4 class="mt3" id="travel--hotel">Travel &amp; hotel</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>We recommend that you travel to Brighton by public transport as parking is notoriously hard to come by, and there is no parking at the venue.</li>
              <li>If you are driving, the nearest NCP carpark is Brighton Theatre on Church Street: https://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/brighton-theatre/</li>
              <li>Standard travel costs are reimbursed after the event, on production of receipts.</li>
              <li>We book you a double room, including breakfast, on Thursday night at a central hotel in Brighton.

            <h4 class="mt3" id="speaker-meal--lunch">Speaker meal &amp; lunch</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>We arrange a meal for all speakers on Thursday evening. In previous years we’ve had a Michelin starred chef cook for us at a private dining space, close to the hotel.</li>
              <li>On conference day, we invite all speakers to attend the whole day if possible. We also take you out for lunch at a restaurant close to the venue.</li>
