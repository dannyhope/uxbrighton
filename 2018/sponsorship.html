            <p>The <a href="https://brightondome.org/about/history_heritage/">Brighton Dome</a> is part of the historical and beautiful Pavilion estate, home to Prince George, the Prince Regent. Originally his riding school and stables, the Concert Hall is a stunning 1200 seated theatre. We've been holding our conference here since 2011 and love its unique brand of Brighton quirkiness.</p>

        <p>We've got lots of ideas, and welcome your suggestions too - we're more than happy to tailor a package to suit your needs.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fun</strong> - Entertainment during the breaks in a day full of cerebral, mind expanding talks can be a great way to engage our delegates. Maybe sponsor a Photobooth. <strong>From £1000</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Useful giveaways</strong> - Quality items such as branded Post-Its, Sharpies, notebooks, reusable aluminium water bottles or coffee cups. Items that UX people want and use long after the conference. <strong>From £1500</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Daytime treats</strong> - Enhance the experience by sponsoring fruit, pastries and coffee throughout the day. Or how about an on-site barista or smoothie bar? <strong>From £750</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Flash your logo</strong> - Lanyards around the neck of every delegate &amp; speaker, volunteer t-shirts, a charging station, even the videography - we'll put your logo &amp; URL at the beginning of each of our filmed talks. <strong>From £500</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Post conference drinks</strong> - Everyone loves the chance to network and discuss the day once the conference wraps, what better way than to sponsor the post conference drinks?! <strong>From £4000</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p class="pt4 pb2">If you're interested in sponsoring, please either email <a href="mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk" class=" bold">emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk</a> or DM <a href="https://twitter.com/direct_messages/create/uxbri" class=" bold">@uxbri</a> (DMs are open).</p>
