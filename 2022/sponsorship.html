      <h2 class="h1 mt5">About UX Brighton</h2>
      <p class="standfirst">Unlike most other conferences, we gather together a mix of academic and industry experts and curate our talks around a single theme.</p>

      <p>Our speakers are individually selected from industry and academia; we make a particular effort to bring new, relevant speakers to our audiences and we have been responsible for bringing a number of now well-known speakers on to the conference circuit.</p>

      <!-- <p><strong>This year’s theme is Advancing Research</strong>. We'll be taking a deep dive into research — looking beyond traditional methods to tackle everything from how research can inform strategy to building research teams; from designing surveys that don't suck, to researching for new technologies.</p> -->

          <p>The Brighton Dome is part of the historical and beautiful Pavilion estate, home to Prince George, the Prince Regent. Originally his riding school and stables, the Concert Hall is a stunning 1200 seated theatre. We’ve been holding our conference here since 2011 and love it’s unique brand of Brighton quirkiness.</p>
          <p>The spacious, double-heighted Foyer Bar provides an excellent space for our sponsors. It’s also where our delegates congregate for refreshments, so they won’t miss you!</p>
