				<h4>Vision, Hearing, &amp; The Brain: The Top 10 Things You Need to Know 
about Perception </h4>
				<p><strong>When you design a website, an app, software, or a product, you expect a human to interact with your design with their perceptual/sensory systems. If you want to design a product that is easy to use, engaging, and that meets your goals and objectives for user experience, then you need to know about the psychology of perception.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>In this keynote Dr. Weinschenk will share her top ten most important research studies on perception – concentrating on vision and hearing, including: the role of peripheral vision vs. central vision, the emotional influence of shapes, why seeing and paying attention are not the same thing, and the power of auditory cues.</strong></p>

Her clients call her “The Brain Lady” because she applies research on brain science to predict, understand, and explain what motivates people and how they behave. Dr. Weinschenk is the author of several books, including <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Get-People-Stuff-Persuasion/dp/0321884507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375281697&sr=8-1&keywords=How+To+Get+People+To+Do+Stuff" class="thing">How To Get People To Do Stuff</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Every-Designer-Needs-People/dp/0321767535/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375281706&sr=8-1&keywords=100+Things+Every+Designer+Needs+To+Know+About+People" class="thing">100 Things Every Designer Needs To Know About People</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neuro-Web-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321603605/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375281716&sr=8-1&keywords=Neuro+Web+Design%3A+What+makes+them+click%3F" class="thing">Neuro Web Design: What makes them click?</a></p>

				<h4>Flying Lessons: what aviation investigations tell other disciplines about user interfaces</h4>
				<p><strong>The aviation industry has developed a special and rather useful focus on the user experiences of pilots. For the last sixty years a very genuine commitment to preventing user errors has made airline flights one of the safest forms of travel. There are a number of innovations in aviation which other areas might perhaps want to imitate. The first step is a change in attitude towards error - something long overdue in IT - but once made it opens the possibility of an evidence-based approach to reducing error. It's worked for aviation&hellip;

				<h4>Designing for human performance: the case for in-bodied interaction</h4>
				<p><strong>Where is the Body in our Technology? Most digital products treat us as if we experience the world from the neck up. Ergonomic chairs, sit/stand desks, suggest that, in the nicest possible way, we attempt to park our bodies in the office, the car, our homes, while we get on with brain/screen interaction. The body, however, is reasserting itself. From obesity to cardiovascular disease, to the consequent costs to GDP of lost time at work from chronic pain and related illness, we have ignored our bodies at our cultural cost. That said, there is a growing body of research that says putting the body back in the picture is good not just for our physical wellbeing, but cognitively,too. Not surprisingly, there is incredible interest in developing interactive technology to help address the problems its helped create. Developers have rushed in. According to one count there are over 3000 ‘health’ apps alone. But do they do any good? For whom? For how long?</strong></p>
				<p><strong>In this presentation, based on recent research, m.c. will describe 4 paths to explore design for human performance, for what we're calling "in-bodied interaction." With these heuristics, designers will have both new spaces for design and new ways to evaluate success for human performance design – where the brain and body are parts of a magnificent complex system, and where we thrive best when we respect that complexity. She will also invite designers to participate in a global human performance challenge to see our designs make a difference towards real quality of life for all. There may be push ups.</strong></p>

				<h4>Psychology &amp; User Experience: 10 Key Concepts</h4>
				<p><strong>In this presentation Patrick will look at 10 key psychological concepts which have implications from the point of view of user experience.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>The concepts come from a wide variety of areas, spanning the history of psychology from its inception as a discipline to the present day. These include: psychoanalysis; behaviourism; humanistic psychology; Gestalt psychology; existentialism and cognitivism.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Each concept will be described and illustrated with examples from the studies through which the concept was established. In some cases inferences and examples will be given as to how it can be applied to UX. In other cases – those where the implications may not be clear (at least to the presenter) – the concepts will be described but their potential use and implications will be left for the audience to consider.</strong></p>

				<h4>Pretending for a living – why actors are all UX designers</h4>
				<p><strong>User Centred Design is all about putting the person at the heart of the design. To do this successfully the UX practitioner needs to understand both the psychological drivers of that person – their motivations, needs and fears, hidden and expressed – as well as the overall situation in which that person is operating. This can sometimes seem daunting.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>But there is another group of people who have been doing a very similar thing for years – actors. They too need to understand the (sometimes hidden) motivations of their character, their emotional and psychological complexities, and their background and environment. And they have strategies and techniques for doing this. Can we as UX professionals perhaps learn from these to better inhabit  and understand our prospective users both from the ‘inside out’ and the ‘outside in’?</strong></p>
			</span>
			<p>A highly experienced interaction designer, Jon has been incorporating user centred design into web design since the 90s, utilising skills and techniques from both his previous career as a professional actor, and has practical experience across the whole spectrum of <abbr title="User-Centered Design">UCD</abbr> activities, from ethnography through behavioural modelling, information architecture, wire-framing, storyboarding and prototyping to formative user testing, as well as the visual design and behaviour of user interfaces.

				<h4>Out of Our Minds</h4>
				<p><strong>There has been a lot of excitement in HCI and Psychology about how we should account for user interaction and cognition in terms of embodied theories of interaction. It is increasingly accepted that we don't simply use our minds when thinking. Instead, we use our hands, bodies and brains in concert with others, objects and the environment by which to think, create and imagine. Models of the mind are being abandoned and replaced by a new lens that focuses on what happens outside of the brain. I will outline some of the fundamental principles of embodied and external cognition that are emerging and illustrate how many of the hot topics and challenges facing UX designers today can benefit from this new approach.</strong></p>

			<p>Yvonne Rogers is a Professor of Interaction Design and director of <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic"><abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> Interaction Centre</a>. Her research interests are in the areas of ubiquitous computing, interaction design and human-computer interaction. A central theme is how to design interactive technologies that can enhance life by augmenting and extending everyday, learning and work activities. This involves informing, building and evaluating novel user experiences through creating and assembling a diversity of pervasive technologies.</p>

			<p>Central to her work is a critical stance towards how visions, theories and frameworks shape the fields of HCI, cognitive science and Ubicomp. She has been instrumental in promulgating new theories (e.g., external cognition), alternative methodologies (e.g., in the wild studies) and far-reaching research agendas (e.g., “<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/hci2020/" class="thing">Being Human: HCI in 2020</a>” manifesto).
