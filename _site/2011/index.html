				<p class="first">The <span class="org">UX Brighton</span> team are proud to be presenting a User Experience Conference at Brighton Dome’s Corn Exchange.</p>
				<p>Whether you’re new to the field or you’re a design industry professional, UX Brighton 2011 is a great opportunity to debate, cogitate and learn about User Experience through the lense of various disciplines stretching from anthropology to cross-channel design. </p>
				<p>Blending provocative thinkers and seasoned professionals from the UK and Europe with speakers from Brighton’s renowned <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> community, we’re here to look at how User Experience design is changing with the times.</p>
				<p>This is our second event, after last year’s success at UX Brighton 2010.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="testimonials">
				<h2>Reviews of 2010</h2>
				<blockquote>
				<p>The very first UX Brighton last September was an incredible event that brought together a lot of talented people. The audience was engaged, informed, and entertaining. Rarely have I had so much fun talking to conference participants and I learned a lot, too. Brighton is a helluva cool town! This could well become one of the top three events in the UK - so get your ticket NOW!</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Eric Reiss</span>, Speaker at UX Brighton 2010, CEO, <span class="org">The FatDUX Group</span></h3>

				<blockquote>
				<p>UX Brighton has been a great experience. It's an intimate conference with a great audience and atmosphere. I loved speaking there and felt honored to be amongst a superb selection of speakers.</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Jeroen van Geel</span>, Speaker at UX Brighton 2010, Founder &amp; CEO, <span class="org">Johnny Holland</span></h3>
				</blockquote>
				
<!--				<blockquote>
				<p>I found the conference an interesting mix of research and <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> driven inspiration. Outside of the interesting subject matter presentations, my key take-out (as an MD of a design and innovation consultancy) was the energy that is currently powering Interaction Design forward and the positive approach to both the discipline and the market place. I will be there again this year. Looking forward to it.</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Matt Pattison</span>, Director and co-founder of <span class="org">7bn, Insight &amp; Strategy</span></h3>
				</blockquote>-->
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>Really enjoyed the day and the wide range of topics covered. Since then I've snuck in plenty of facts from the talks into client meetings and it's helped to improve my <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> skills. Ace.</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Ali Pettit</span>, Senior Account Manager, <span class="org">Public Life</span></h3>
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>The UX Brighton conference has managed, in its first year, to put together a group of speakers worthy of a much higher ticket price. The atmosphere created was entertaining and exciting to be in. I look forward to the next one.</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Martin Gordon</span>, Marketing Designer, <span class="org">dotDigital Group plc</span></h3>
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>I found UXBrighton 2010 to be both thought provoking and useful - the speakers were insightful and I had a great time chatting with like-minded UXers. Looking forward to 2011!</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Al Power</span>, Web Development Lead, <span class="org">Nominet UK</span></h3>
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>This was my first <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> event and will definitely not be my last. I took away plenty of tips that I can apply to web writing, as well as an improved understanding of how my audience thinks and interacts with web pages.</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Helen Keevy</span>, Core Copywriting</h3>
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>The first UX Brighton was insightful with some great speakers who raised interesting arguments. I look forward to seeing what the next conference has to offer.</p>
				<h3><span class='reviewer'>Elly Boulboul</span>, Graphic Designer, <span class="org">Strawberry Soup</span></h3>
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>I found UX Brighton 2010 to be entertaining and informative - a good combination in my book. UX Brighton is important in championing the needs of users, something often overlooked, yet central to the success of products we make.</p>

<h3><abbr title="2011-11-04T10:05:00">10.05</abbr> Robin Dunbar</h3>
<h4>Connecting anthropology and User Experience: <span class="expansion">What can we learn from the study of social behaviour and how groups function most effectively?</span></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/about-us/staff/academic/prof-robin-dunbar/">Professor Robin Dunbar</a> is a British anthropologist who specialises in the evolution of sociality. His work is fundamental to User Experience design and the implications of his findings are vast when it comes to designing social spaces.</p>
<h4>What’s he known for?</h4>
<p>Robin is best known for formulating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">Dunbar's number</a> which can be defined as:
<strong>“The measurement of the cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships.”</strong> He theorised that this was a limit of 150 individuals. The implications of this for User Experience design are vast when it comes to designing social spaces and creating communities.</p>
<p>His principle research areas also include the behavioural ecology of social decision-making, modelling socio-ecological systems and their evolution, the structure and dynamics of social networks, and the nature of social bonding.</p>
<h4>The credentials</h4>
<p>He is currently <strong>Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology and the Director of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology of the University of Oxford</strong> and the Co-director of the British Academy Centenary Research Project.</p>

<h4>Designing cross-channel user experiences</h4>
<p>50 years ago we relied on books and people for information, then we gradually started going to our desktop computers to look things up, now we've got iPads and other restless, smaller, faster physical devices.</p>
<p>Information is bleeding out of the Internet and becoming ever more embedded in the real world. The boundaries are blurring between the physical and the digital.</p>
<p>Our experiences travel across channels: we check something out on the web, we get texts, we go to the shop, we bring the thing home, we connect it, we get more services online. Shouldn't our design vision reflect this behaviour too?</p>
<h4>What’s he known for?</h4>
<p><a href="http://andrearesmini.com/">Andrea Resmini</a> is President of the <a href="http://iainstitute.org/">Information Architecture Institute</a>, he chairs the <a href="http://iasummit.it/">Italian IA Summit</a>, is a founding member of the <a href="http://www.ecux.org/">European centre for user experience</a>, and finally is one of the founders and now an Associate Editor for the <a href="http://journalofia.org/">Journal of Information Architecture</a>.</p>
<h4>The credentials</h4>
<p>Andrea has been working as an ICT professional since 1989. He holds an MA in Architecture and Industrial Design and a PhD in Legal Informatics and IT Law. He’s now working at the <a href="http://www.hb.se/wps/portal/research/researchers/andrea-resmini">University of Borâs</a>, Sweden, researching and teaching IA- and <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>-related courses while still hoisting the IA flag at <a href="http://www.fatdux.com/who/person/andrea-resmini/">FatDUX</a>, a leading <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> firm based in Copenhagen with offices all over Europe, the US and Canada.</p>

	<h3><abbr title="2011-11-04T12:05:00">12.05</abbr> Mike Atherton</h3>
	<h4>Beyond the Polar Bear</h4>
<p><strong>Domain-driven design</strong> breaks down complex subjects into the things people usually think about. By intersecting across subjects, links themselves become facts, allowing humans and machines to learn through undirected user journeys. This paradigm shift from labeling boxes to taming rich data is a vital skill for the modern Information Architect.
</p>	
<p>	Using case studies from the BBC’s Food and Natural History products, you’ll learn to unlock the potential of your content, create scalable navigation patterns, and achieve simply fabulous SEO. The next web is here. Stop worrying about the perfect taxonomy, and start worrying about making your content findable, pointable, searchable and sharable. 
</p>	
<h4>What’s he known for?</h4>
<p>An enthusiast of evidence-based design and content strategy, <a href="http://reduxd.com/">Mike</a> evangelises to management types on the need to think beyond business drivers and make stuff people actually care about. He has spoken on topics as diverse as Domain Modelling and Disneyland at conferences in the UK and the US.</p>

<h4>The credentials</h4>
<p>Over 15 years in the business, man and boy, Mike is an independent UX consultant who is passionate about sensible data structures, and fights to ensure user experience extends outside the boundaries of any one website. Lately he's been busy figuring out how the BBC’s archive of factual programming can be used to build popular products.

<h4>The aging question, dignity through design</h4>
<p>There are currently 11 million people in the UK aged between 45 and 60. They own 70% of the nation's wealth. In 20 years time they could own 85-90% of disposable income in the UK. Recent figures show that those aged 50+ spend more time online that 18-24 year olds. In addition, there are equal numbers of those over 55 with iPhones as there are in the 24-30 age bracket, which challenges the assumption older generations don't use cutting edge technology.
</p>
<p>Simon will talk about the role that technology plays in older adults lives; how their relationship with technology differs to that of the young; how having the latest gadgets helps you keep connected; how technology can alienate and stigmatise older users; what older people may want out of technology. He’ll highlight the myths and bust a few along the way before discussing a Universal Design solution.
</p>
<h4>What he’s known for?</h4>
<p>In his own words, Simon is <q>a mad Geordie that grew up in the Bahamas and lives with his Nepalese wife and 4 cats in SE London</q>. He’s also an experienced Usability Consultant and designer with strong qualitative research background. In particular ethnographic research including contextual/depth interviews with more than 300 user interviews on the behalf of international blue chip clients.
</p>
<p>He’s also involved with the UK Usability scene having spoken at UPA in London and Brighton on several occasions.</p>
<h4>The credentials</h4>
<p>Running ethnography projects for Vodafone and Sky. As a usability consultant with Flow Interactive, mainly doing lab-based interviews for clients including <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>, The Guardian, Reuters, Law society, Yell, Play.com, SonyBMG, etc.

<h4>The <abbr title="Return On Investment">ROI</abbr> of design</h4>






<p>One of the biggest challenges in convincing businesses to engage with design is to demonstrate its value. Deducing the value of a project can be very hard due to many complicating factors, not least that the client is often unwilling to share the difference in their bottom line.
</p>
<p>This talk focuses on how to articulate the value of design to businesses, using relevant examples. It discusses the way that value for money can be framed and discussed before a project, and how to understand the impact of your project afterwards.
</p>

<h4>What is he known for?
</h4>
<p>John has been working to create elegant and useful interfaces for over eight years. He has worked for clients in Financial Services, Energy, Government and National Security. He is currently Principal of Research at Electronic Ink. He has also worked as a neuroscientist, making contributions to our understanding of human oculomotor function. John spent a year running the largest ever survey in Europe, and as a hobby has an interest in multivariate data visualisation.
</p>

<h4>The credentials
</h4>
<p>John has a PhD in Human Factors Psychology from the University of Bristol. He has worked on large scale projects for FTSE100 organisations, including a project that keep the lights on in the UK, and others that are paramount to our national security.

<h4>Designing the wider web</h4>
<p>The dominance of the desktop browser is over. The web is wider now. It’s time to move away from ‘device specific thinking’ and time to transcend ‘platformism’. Now we’re designing for contexts, displays, connectivity, and inputs by breaking devices down into first principles. Designers should now be aiming to create great user experiences using the truly fluid nature of the web.</p>
<h4>What’s he known for?</h4>
<p><a href="http://cennydd.co.uk/">Cennydd</a>’s book ‘Undercover User Experience Design’ has been acclaimed as "a must have for your bookshelf”, and his second book “Designing the wider web” is due out this winter. He writes a popular design blog and regularly contributes to influential publications including Pervasive IA, A List Apart, Johnny Holland and .Net Magazine in which he promotes thoughtful, ethical design that touches people's lives.</p>
<h4>The credentials</h4>
<p>Cennydd is a <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designer with nine years of professional experience. He often speaks at design and technology conferences across the world, including SXSW, Future of Web Apps, and the prestigious closing keynote at the 2011 Information Architecture Summit. His thoughts on design have been quoted by the Guardian, PBS, Design Week and the Abu Dhabi National.</p>
<p>As an active member of the British user experience community, he co-founded the UX London and UXCampLondon conferences.</p>
