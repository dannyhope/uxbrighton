## About the workshop

UX Brighton are proud to announce our first workshop. We have partnered with UX Consultant and analytics specialist Luke Hay to bring you a workshop on using Analytics for better UX. As this is our pilot workshop we are able to offer a discounted rate making this course great value for money.  

We’re limiting the number of places to ensure that the course is intimate and focussed on helping you learn how to apply analytics to User Experience in just one day. The course will focus on Google Analytics but will also touch upon other analytics packages and techniques. We’ll look at analytics from a UX perspective highlighting practical uses and helping to demystify the data.

Knowledge of analytics will help to make you a better UXer because you’ll be able to:

- Back-up your discussions with data
- Quickly getting a big picture of what’s going on with your products
- Help your team understand what’s actually going on
- Find out which areas of your product need work
- Decide where to focus qualitative research
- Guide your company to better decisions

Reserve your place today for just £149.
