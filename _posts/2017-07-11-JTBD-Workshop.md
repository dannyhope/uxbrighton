__How to use the Jobs To Be Done framework to improve your research process__

We’re delighted to welcome Jillian Wells back to Brighton after her popular talk at last year’s UX Brighton conference. Jillian will be running a hands-on practical workshop on how to use the Jobs To Be Done framework. Using JTBD at Intercom has given her unparalleled insight into the best ways to use the framework to get results.

## About the workshop

<img id="Jillian" src="../assets/2017-jtbdWorkshop/jillian-wells-adjusted-1362.jpg" alt="Photo of Jillian" class="speaker-photo">

A job to be done (JTBD) is a revolutionary concept that guides you a better understanding of your users’ motivations and helps you innovate. A JTBD is not a product, service, or a specific solution; it's the higher purpose for which your customers buy products, services, and solutions.

Many UXers are switching to JTBD at the moment and this workshop will demystify the technique and give you an understanding of how you can put JTBD to practical use on your UX projects. 

## Activities

Places are limited to just 15 attendees in order to enable a highly interactive focussed workshop where during the day you will:

1. Plan for a JTBD Research Project
2. Define their audiences
3. Write JTBD scripts
4. Write JTBD stories
5. Complete the JTBD process from start to finish

Through a series of practical exercises you will gain a thorough understanding of when and how to use JTBD.

## What you’ll learn

You’ll start by learning what JTBD is and when it should be used before moving on to running our own JTBD projects for common products.

Through a series of practical exercises you’ll learn:

1. What JTBD is and when it should be used 
2. How JTBD differs from using design personas
3. What a switch interview is and how to use one
4. Learning the anatomy of a job story, and how to structure them
5. What to do when JTBD goes awry
6. A whole host of tips for using JTBD in your projects

## Who should attend this workshop

The JTBD framework enables practitioners across different disciplines to works together better, the workshop is suitable for anyone who is involved in the research process. No previous experience with JTBD is needed and this workshop is particularly suitable for:

* Researchers
* Product owners
* Entrepreneurs
* Content strategists
* UX designers
* App designers

## What people have said about UX Brighton workshops

> Great workshop - it exceeded all my expectations!
—Caroline Owen

> The trainer was lovely, inspiring and very professional. The way she both shared us her insights and got us working together served the purpose perfectly.
—Heikki

> Helped me understand and share experiences with other UXers.
—Paul Swain

> Sound, focussed and practical advice about preparing for, facilitating and then following-up on workshops. Alison was a fun, enthusiastic and knowledgeable tutor. Recommended :-)
—Patrick Sansom

> Really insightful workshop. It was useful to have practical examples rather than just an overview
—Tracy Godding

> Seriously impressed by the standard of delivery and quality of teaching during this session. I have to be fairly well-versed in psychological theories due to working with psychologists on a day-to-day basis in my job, but the insight into how to apply theories to UX was absolutely invaluable. Also as someone who teaches sessions on a regular basis, I have to say that the teaching was inspirational!
-Fiona MacNeill

> A fast paced really insightful day. Definitely worth attending! I would recommend to anyone interested in user experience and psychology. 
-Sophie Harper

> I really enjoyed Joe's workshop on Psychology for Design. We learnt theories, processes and research methods. And it wasn't long until we were applying them in practice; to collaborate, create and evaluate designs for a better user experience.
-Nirmal Dhiman
