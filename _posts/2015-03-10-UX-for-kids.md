Covering a variety issues, but specifically tricky ones like how do we handle usernames/passwords 
for younger kids that might not yet have a good reading/typing ability, how you design for age 
groups that might span quite a wide range, what developmental issues need to be taken into consideration, 
etc. Ideally, I'd try and get people from Mind Candy, Toca, My Maths and similar. 
Collecting [links](https://pinboard.in/u:jaygooby/t:kids.ux+uxbri/ "Jays links on Pinboard") also I've started to chat to TocaBoca - 
have been passed on to their PR team by megan@tocaboca.com
