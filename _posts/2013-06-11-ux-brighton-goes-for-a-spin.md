Whatever our relationship with the automobile, it has played an important role in our transport and distribution systems for centuries. As driver, passenger, or pedestrian, our interactions with the car present a host of challenges for engineers, researchers, and UX specialists.

The evening introduced speakers from the automotive industry, as they shared their experiences designing for this enduring interface between human and machine.
