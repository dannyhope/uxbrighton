Also known as "comfort design", "functional design", or "user-friendly systems", HF&E is the practice of designing products, systems or processes to take proper account of the interaction between them and the people that use them. As you can imagine, there's plenty to learn from this multidisciplinary field. Speakers for the evening are all Senior Lecturers from the University of Brighton's School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics.

Catherine&#8217;s interests have led to involvement beyond product development to computer games, web design and app design and digital product design.

Using a set of interaction principles as a basis, we consider how understanding our perception mechanisms can help to create beautiful and usable artefacts across two and three dimensions. From the aim to create clear and readable artefacts (achieving ‘Clarity’) to helping the user to be engaged ( in a state of ‘Flow’) when using an interface, interaction goals are similar for different media and brainstorming across disciplines can sometimes help.
