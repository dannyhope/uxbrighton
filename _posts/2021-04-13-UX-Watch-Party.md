## UX Brighton Show & Tell: a Watch Party takeover!

Tuesday 13th April 2021, 7-9pm

---

Guest MC Fiona MacNeill will present a series of short films on themes relevant to our UX interests, using the BETA web application [backyard.co](https://backyard.co/). Between each video we’ll have breaks for discussion, challenges and more. 

Like Show and Tell, places are limited to 12. And it's still free. 

Unlike Show and Tell you do not need to bring anything to present or discuss. All you need is an open mind - and a laptop or tablet capable of running the web app.

**Sign up and find out more at [this shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r23QcNURzNlRqqaWKIo-NLP7CqErkd7bRlquoh8gZtE/edit#).**
