2. improve your discovery process?

And, leave with actionable insights to elevate your discovery process. 

## Time team: Documenting decisions and marking milestones ‚Äì Paul Robert Lloyd

Exercise regularly; eat plenty of vegetables; floss your teeth. Tasks that feel like chores are often the most beneficial in the long run. The same is true of writing documentation.\
\
Documenting decisions, recording design iterations and explaining commonly used terminology means everyone on a team can have a shared understanding of a product‚Äôs design and evolution. Making this information public can increase accountability and build trust. Deliberately building institutional memory can prevent mistakes being repeated and lessons needing to be learnt over and over again.\
\
In this talk, we‚Äôll look at how to record and recall design decisions and consider the role designers play in cultivating a fun yet inclusive culture within a team, and the potential pitfalls to avoid when doing so.

## The Agile Comms Handbook: How to Improve Team Collaboration and Boost Clarity ‚Äì Giles Turnbull

"Agile comms handbook" author Giles Turnbull takes a look at how some teams remember, and what that means for them: better connections with leaders, stakeholders, and colleagues in other teams. Better clarity. More understanding. Less \*mis\*understanding. He'll look at real life teams, and a fictional one - and wonder out loud about what team memory could look like for the rest of us. Why is it good to amplify agile working with agile comms? How does it contribute to an atmosphere of safety and trust? And on a more practical note: What needs to change? Who needs to change it? Whose job is that going to be?

Giles was co-creator of the¬†[It‚Äôs OK](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/)¬†poster at GDS, which was subsequently¬†[exhibited at the 2017 Vienna Biennale](http://2017.viennabiennale.org/en/exhibitions/detail/the-future-of-work/).

Giles authored¬†*[The agile comms handbook](https://agilecommshandbook.com/)*, and edited¬†*[Content Design](https://contentdesign.london/store/the-content-design-book/)*¬†by Sarah Winters,¬†*[Content Transformation](https://contentdesign.london/shop/content-transformation-by-hinrich-von-haaren-paperback)*¬†by Hinrich von Haaren, and¬†*[The Team Onion](https://teamonion.works/buy-the-book/)*¬†by Emily Webber.
