And, leave with actionable insights to elevate your discovery process. 

## Time team: Documenting decisions and marking milestones ‚Äì Paul Robert Lloyd

Exercise regularly; eat plenty of vegetables; floss your teeth. Tasks that feel like chores are often the most beneficial in the long run. The same is true of writing documentation.\
\
Documenting decisions, recording design iterations and explaining commonly used terminology means everyone on a team can have a shared understanding of a product‚Äôs design and evolution. Making this information public can increase accountability and build trust. Deliberately building institutional memory can prevent mistakes being repeated and lessons needing to be learnt over and over again.\
\
In this talk, we‚Äôll look at how to record and recall design decisions and consider the role designers play in cultivating a fun yet inclusive culture within a team, and the potential pitfalls to avoid when doing so.
