## Designing for Humanity: A UX Journey in Humanitarian Aid ‚Äì Olena Bulygina

This is a talk about applied design. We will venture to the land of humanitarian aid and follow a story of applying a design skill set to a set of challenges, such as lack of equipment, lack of medical supplies, in times of war.\
\
We will look together at processes, challenges and the successes and failures that one might experience when the only option is to apply all skills to a very complex subject matter. We will witness bottom up changes in the healthcare system that start with individual impact: the impact of ideas. It is also a story about systems, and how we implement change in them, omitting the notion of centralised control.

## Time team: Documenting decisions and marking milestones ‚Äì Paul Robert Lloyd

Exercise regularly; eat plenty of vegetables; floss your teeth. Tasks that feel like chores are often the most beneficial in the long run. The same is true of writing documentation.\
\
Documenting decisions, recording design iterations and explaining commonly used terminology means everyone on a team can have a shared understanding of a product‚Äôs design and evolution. Making this information public can increase accountability and build trust. Deliberately building institutional memory can prevent mistakes being repeated and lessons needing to be learnt over and over again.\
\
In this talk, we‚Äôll look at how to record and recall design decisions and consider the role designers play in cultivating a fun yet inclusive culture within a team, and the potential pitfalls to avoid when doing so.
