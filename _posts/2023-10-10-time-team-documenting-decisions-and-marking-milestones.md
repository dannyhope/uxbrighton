## Time team: Documenting decisions and marking milestones – Paul Robert Lloyd  

Exercise regularly; eat plenty of vegetables; floss your teeth. Tasks that feel like chores are often the most beneficial in the long run. The same is true of writing documentation.\
\
In this talk, we’ll look at how to record and recall design decisions and some tools to help us do that. We’ll also learn how to celebrate achievements while considering the role designers can play in cultivating a fun yet inclusive culture within a team.
