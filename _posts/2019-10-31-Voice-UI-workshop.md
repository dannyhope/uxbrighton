## Designing for voice

<p class="standfirst mt2">Voice UI is growing fast. Although we’re all competent in person-to-person conversation, designing a good conversation is a new challenge for most organisations. </p>


Modern voice interfaces are an opportunity to create better products in new contexts. Smart adoption of VUIs in the right environment makes interaction simple, pleasurable, accessible and lowers cognitive load. 

In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn all about the challenges in designing for voice, how it differs from screen, how to make it great, and then put their learnings into practice. Teams will choose from suggested scenarios to explore voice’s potential and create their own prototype. 

Each workshop team will test the effectiveness and enjoyability of their prototyped voice interfaces using the Wizard of Oz methods practised by teams at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. And each participant will take home resources useful for future VUI work.

Side note: Prototyping in voice is both faster, and more fun than prototyping for screen!

Join us to expand your design skills with a new interaction tool that’s as old as humanity: **voice.**

## Who should attend
This workshop is for anyone curious about working in voice, including designers, decision-makers, and engineers who are interested in ubiquitous computing, calm technology, bots, NO-UI, and thinking outside of the screen.

## What you’ll learn
- How to design a voice interface

- How designing ‘conversation’ differs from screen interactions

- Key principles and methods for voice design

- Understanding of how to prototype voice with Wizard of Oz methods
