**We kick the new year off with a terrific replay of five talks from UX Camp Brighton 2014. With so many great sessions, selecting just five has been tricky. What we've gone for represents a nice spread of the huge range of topics covered on the day.**

## Carlos Saba - The Minimum Loveable Product

In the precarious startup world the ability to solve a customer's problem isn't enough. Engaging users and building a passionate following counts just as much as (if not more than) building useful and usable software. For any startup speed is key and Carlos will talk about how to get digital ideas to market sooner while still delivering a product that users fall in love with. Carlos is co–founder of Brighton Agency [Spook Studio](http://www.spookstudio.com/ "") & [The Happy Startup School](http://thehappystartupschool.com/ "").

Sophie will be talking about how introverts and extroverts approach UX and how that effects the process. Sophie is a UX Architect / Front End Developer who has worked in a variety of fast paced digital agencies. Sophie has turned her hand to UX over the past few years, concentrating on delivering experiences that are focused around what the user needs. She recently set up and co-organises the London group of [Ladies That UX](http://www.ladiesthatux.com/ "").

## Ellen de Vries - The choreography of space

The average person spends more time thinking about things, rather than the spaces between things. Fact. Space is content. This talk is about how artists morph, mould and manipulate space (and the spaces between things) to adjust the way we receive information. There will be flash cards and some hardcore choreographic theory. Ellen is a content strategist & experimental performance arts maker.

## Chris How - Yippee-IA

Information architecture (IA) is the art and science of organising and labelling websites to support task completion and intuitive access to content. In 5 minutes I'll tell you all the secrets and skills you'll ever need to know to be a successful Information Architect. In the rest of the session we'll get hands-on with a tricky information space - my spice drawer. Chris is head of User Experience at [Cogapp](http://www.cogapp.com/ "").
