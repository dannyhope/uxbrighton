**We kick the new year off with a terrific replay of five talks from UX Camp Brighton 2014. With so many great sessions, selecting just five has been tricky. What we've gone for represents a nice spread of the huge range of topics covered on the day.**

## The Minimum Loveable Product – Carlos Saba

In the precarious startup world the ability to solve a customer's problem isn't enough. Engaging users and building a passionate following counts just as much as (if not more than) building useful and usable software. For any startup speed is key and Carlos will talk about how to get digital ideas to market sooner while still delivering a product that users fall in love with. Carlos is co–founder of Brighton Agency [Spook Studio](http://www.spookstudio.com/ "") & [The Happy Startup School](http://thehappystartupschool.com/ "").

Everyone has heard of introversion and extroversion. In this session Sophie will be looking at how they are perceived and what the characteristics of each really are. We'll be doing a short quiz to find out where you sit on the extrovert / introvert spectrum. We'll then be discussing whether it helps or hinders to be either an an extrovert or introvert in the field of UX. Sophie is a Front End Web Developer / UX Designer at [McCormack & Morrison](http://www.mccormackmorrison.com "") and she also recently set up and co-organises the London group of [Ladies That UX](http://www.ladiesthatux.com/ "").

## The Choreography of Space – Ellen de Vries

<div class="responsive-height-limiter"><div class="embed-container hd"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZQrMqJcfm4" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

The average person spends more time thinking about things, rather than the spaces between things. Fact. Space is content. This talk is about how artists morph, mould and manipulate space (and the spaces between things) to adjust the way we receive information. There will be flash cards and some hardcore choreographic theory. Ellen is a content strategist & experimental performance arts maker.
