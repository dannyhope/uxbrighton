Join us at our Summer Social with [Ben Sauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bensauer/), author of [Death by Screens: how to present high-stakes digital design work and live to tell the tale](https://bensauer.net/deathbyscreens/). Take the opportunity to meet Ben and learn more about his new book. If you're lucky, you may even get a signed copy.

During the meet and greet, you'll have the opportunity to learn more about his process, ask questions and gain invaluable insights that can help take your own UX skills to the next level.

If the weather doesn't cooperate, we'll have a table inside where we can still enjoy drinks and catch up with one another. Come ready to meet new people, share ideas and enjoy a relaxing evening in good company.Â ðŸŒž

Ben Sauer is a product and design leader, formerly of Babylon Health and Clearleft. He's worked with organisations like the BBC, Pearson, Tesco, and TCS to raise their product game.

Heâ€™s been speaking and training people all around the world, with a focus on voice UI for several years; particularly in how to rapidly design conversational experiences. Teams at Amazon and the BBC use his methods, and through O'Reilly, he's trained folks at NASA. Heâ€™s also spent many hours at home removing the ridiculous things that his kids have added to Alexaâ€™s shopping list.
