Let's hang out and meet fellow uxers in the sun at the UX Brighton Summer Social. If the weather doesn't cooperate, we'll have a table inside where we can still enjoy drinks and catch up with one another. Come ready to meet new people, share ideas and enjoy a relaxing evening in good company.Â ðŸŒž
