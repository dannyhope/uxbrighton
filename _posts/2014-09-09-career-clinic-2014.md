Taking the format of a careers clinic this event was aimed at giving advice to UX students, graduates, junior practitioners, those new to UX and those wanting to develop their career.

A team of career advisors, made up of the some of the best UX professionals in Brighton were on-hand to give one-to-one advice to those interested in starting, moving into or upwards in User Experience.

Around 150 job seekers and career changers signed up to attend and we'd like to thank the advisors, who came from around 15 different companies, for giving their opinions and advice.
