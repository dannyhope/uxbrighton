## New to Agile/Scrum?

We’re assuming that most people will have a basic understanding of how Agile works so that the speakers won’t have to talk much about the process. That said, if you’re not au fait with agile you might find @hamids’ SCRUM in Under 10 Minutes video useful (scrum is a popular agile method).
