The UX Brighton Show & Tell is a low-key event. A supportive environment for sharing, advice and discussion.

Whether you’re a UXer of many years’ standing, new to UX or UX is only part of what you do, so much the better. A mix of skills and backgrounds enriches the conversation. 

**It's free. Sign up at [this shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KYHjZx-OhRgAO-_i1Z556v46nwFCwZQvjJzKBPsP6k/edit#) with your Show & Tell topic.** 

Show & Tell places are limited to 12, as we keep the group small enough for everyone to learn each other's names.

## How Show & Tell works

- Everyone arrives with something to talk about and some snacks to share
- Names and topics go into a hat, to be chosen at random 
- 15-minute timebox for each discussion 
- Everything is off the record - [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule). (If you’re under NDA, it’s OK to be non-specific about your client. We won’t interrogate you!)

## Deciding on a topic for Show & Tell

If you’re not sure what to share at the Show & Tell, here are some prompts:

- Talk us through what you’re working on
- Show how you’re using a tool or method 
- Get advice on an approach to a project
- Share a past project
- Tell us about a new process
- Discuss working practices
- Get feedback on a talk, workshop or article idea
- Show a short demo or video

Still stuck? It’s more than fine to bring a question or introduce a topic for discussion.
