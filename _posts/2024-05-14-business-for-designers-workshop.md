## What people have said about UX Brighton workshops

> Great workshop - it exceeded all my expectations!

—Caroline Owen

> The trainer was lovely, inspiring and very professional. The way she both shared us her insights and got us working together served the purpose perfectly.

—Heikki

> Helped me understand and share experiences with other UXers.

—Paul Swain

> Sound, focussed and practical advice about preparing for, facilitating and then following-up on workshops. Alison was a fun, enthusiastic and knowledgeable tutor. Recommended :-)

—Patrick Sansom

> Really insightful workshop. It was useful to have practical examples rather than just an overview

—Tracy Godding
