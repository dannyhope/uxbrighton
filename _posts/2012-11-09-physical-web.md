The web has spilled beyond the screen and into the physical world. The Internet of Things (IOT) brings net connectivity to household appliances, common everyday objects and novel devices.

But what challenges does this brave new world present to UX designers? What heuristics, interaction metaphors and prototyping techniques can we rely on to create great user experiences for the web of things? Join us for an evening with three fantastic speakers who'll share their stories of designing the next generation of smart objects.

## Designing the things in the internet of things – Daniel Soltis

The internet of things offers a host of unfamiliar interactions -- objects as interfaces, objects connected to apps, actions that create consequences at a distance. How do people learn and understand digital systems when there is no screen, or controls are gestural, or input and output are at a distance? And while we’re at it, how might UX design make a difference in this emerging field?

Daniel Soltis is a user experience designer and creative technologist at Moving Brands. He’s interested in the physicality of interfaces and the rough edges where technology, design, and sociology meet. You can find him online at @ds1935 and danielsoltis.com.
