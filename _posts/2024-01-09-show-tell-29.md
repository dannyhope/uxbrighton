The UX Brighton Show & Tell is a low-key event. A supportive environment for sharing, advice and discussion.

Whether you’re a UXer of many years’ standing, new to UX or UX is only part of what you do, so much the better. A mix of skills and backgrounds enriches the conversation.

**It’s free. [Sign up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17F37NTy0DD0EE0G04zzSHUQN06JNbALyZ9_S3T_NGIM/edit?usp=sharing) at this shared Google Doc with your Show & Tell topic.**

Please bring drinks and snacks to share **🍪🍺**

Show & Tell places are limited to 12, as we keep the group small enough for everyone to learn each other’s names.

## How Show & Tell works

* Everyone arrives with something to talk about and some snacks to share
* Names and topics go into a hat, to be chosen at random
* 15-minute timebox for each discussion
* Everything is off the record - [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule). (If you’re under NDA, it’s OK to be non-specific about your client. We won’t interrogate you!)

## Deciding on a topic for Show & Tell

If you’re not sure what to share at the Show & Tell, here are some prompts:

* Talk us through what you’re working on
* Show how you’re using a tool or method
* Get advice on an approach to a project
* Share a past project
* Tell us about a new process
* Discuss working practices
* Get feedback on a talk, workshop or article idea
* Show a short demo or video

Still stuck? It’s more than fine to bring a question or introduce a topic for discussion.
