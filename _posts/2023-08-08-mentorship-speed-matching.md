Want to be part of UX Brighton's next [Mentorship Programme](https://uxbri.org/mentorship)? Join us for an evening of Mentorship Speed Matching. Whether you’re a UXer of many years standing, new to UX or UX is only part of what you do, so much the better. A mix of skills and backgrounds enriches the community. You can choose to be a mentor or mentee or you can sign up to be both! 

## **How does mentorship speed matching work?**

* Get your ticket
* Attend the Speed Matching evening with a goal in mind that you would like to achieve from working with a mentor or mentee. 
* You’ll chat with other ambitious uxer's looking to pair up, in true speed-matching style. It's useful to have a specific question in mind related to your goal but also think about what you can offer as a mentor.
* Rate your connections on your speed-matching scorecard and hand it in.
* After the event, our matching team will study your scorecards and endeavour to pair everyone up.*
* We’ll be in touch with what we hope will be your perfect mentorship match.

## **What happends after I've been paired up?**

* Commit to meeting with your mentor and/or mentee for at least one hour per month (virtually or face-to-face) until April 2024. You could use this time to work towards your goal. 

Tickets include drinks and pizza. 🍕🥤

\*We will do our best to ensure everyone gets a match but we can’t make any promises.
