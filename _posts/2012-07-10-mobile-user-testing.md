What are the objectives when we test handheld devices? What are the difficulties and what equipment should we use to best capture the sessions for ourselves and others who want to observe? Walt has pondered these questions while experimenting extensively with cameras, rigs and software. He'll be sharing his stories, demoing his mobile testing setup and recommending ways to make your research simpler to accomplish and deliver better quality evidence.
