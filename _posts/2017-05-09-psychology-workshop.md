We’ve partnered with UX Consultant and author [Joe Leech](https://mrjoe.uk/) to bring you a workshop on using psychology for better UX.

In this one-day event we'll look at how people build mental models of the world around them and how we can use that knowledge to create great user experiences.

## About the workshop

The workshop will provide a practical, hands on way to understand how the human brain works and apply that knowledge to User Experience and product design.

In the workshop, you’ll learn the psychological principles behind how our brain makes sense of the world, and apply that to product and user interface design.

This is a hands-on workshop so expect to be sketching, designing and applying the psychology from the very start.

After the workshop you’ll be able to:

  1. Design products, apps and websites that match how people think and behave
  2. Find, understand, evaluate and apply psychology theory to digital product design
  3. Make informed design decisions and advocate to the wider team using psychology theory

After this workshop and you’ll be able to put psychology into practice as soon as you get back to the office.

## What you’ll learn

We'll go right back to the fundamental psychology theories underpinning planning, decision making and perception. We'll build from there on how users decide what to do in certain situations. We’ll also cover why many websites fail because they don't match the model and thus the expectation the user has for how they will work.

Through a series of practical exercises you’ll learn:

1. Why you should match design to behaviour and what goes wrong when you don't
2. The psychological theory behind how people model a task
3. How to match your design to the map/model and make it a success
4. Mapping and designing the details using a psychological approach
5. Loads of little psychology tidbits that will improve a design and make you a better designer
