## UX Brighton Show & Tell 7

Tuesday 10th March 2020, 7-9pm

[PLATF9RM, Floors 5 & 6, 44 North Road, Brighton, BN1 1YR](https://www.google.com/maps?sll=50.825635,-0.141572&q=Floor+5+and+6,+Tower+Point,+North+Road+Brighton,+BN1+1YR&z=12)

The UX Brighton Show & Tell is a low-key event. A supportive environment for sharing, advice and discussion.

Whether you’re a UXer of many years’ standing, new to UX or UX is only part of what you do, so much the better. A mix of skills and backgrounds enriches the conversation. 

**It's free. Sign up at [this shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1riwInAlIDCuX9b_4SjpHU0JKmczlI-YoP2Fi0-0cma4/edit?usp=sharing) with your Show & Tell topic.** 

Show & Tell places are limited to 12, as we keep the group small enough for everyone in the room to learn each other's names. 



## How Show & Tell works

- Everyone arrives with something to talk about and some snacks to share
- Names and topics go into a hat, to be chosen at random 
- 15-minute timebox for each discussion 
- Everything is off the record - [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule). (If you’re under NDA, it’s OK to be non-specific about your client. We won’t interrogate you!) 



## Deciding on a topic for Show & Tell

If you’re not sure what to share at the Show & Tell, here are some prompts:

- Talk us through what you’re working on
- Show how you’re using a tool or method 
- Get advice on an approach to a project
- Share a past project
- Tell us about a new process
- Discuss working practices
- Get feedback on a talk, workshop or article idea
- Show a short demo or video

Still stuck? It’s more than fine to bring a question or introduce a topic for discussion.



## What people say about Show & Tell

> A very welcoming, thoughtful, knowledgeable and inclusive community.

> The informal format allowed everyone to contribute and ask questions without judgement. I’d encourage everyone from old UX hands to newbies to go along.

—Mat Walker

> Super chilled evening. Everyone was from different walks of UX-related life – from research to design to copywriting to data visualisation, which meant the discussions and feedback came from loads of different angles.
