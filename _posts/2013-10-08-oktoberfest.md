UX Brighton evenings returned with UX Oktoberfest - our last event before November's big conference. Join us on 8th October at Fabrica Gallery for three talks from three fantastic speakers, none of whom - sadly - have consented to wearing their lederhosen.

## Using Design for Competitive Advantage - [Andy Budd](http://www.twitter.com/andybudd)

Why do so many digital companies favour technology over design? In his talk Andy will explain How startups (and any other business) can use design for more than making something pretty. Instead Andy believes that design is one of the few areas of competitive advantage left.
