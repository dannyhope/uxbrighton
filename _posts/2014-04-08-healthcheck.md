Denise will explore some of the subconscious rules-of-thumb that people use to help them make decisions, change their behaviour and navigate their way through everyday life, and how we can use this insight to improve customer experience in health and care.

## Medication reminder apps: the Bad and the Ugly - [Katarzyna Stawarz](http://twitter.com/falkowata) - [usabilitypanda.com](http://usabilitypanda.com/)

Katarzyna's talk will explore how women remember their oral contraception pills and what technologies or memory aids they use. Katarzyna will compare these strategies with functionality of medication reminder apps available for iPhones and Android phones to highlight the fact that these apps aren't very good. She'll go on to cover recommendations for designing medication reminders that meet users' needs.
