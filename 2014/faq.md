# Frequently Asked Questions

**If you have a question that&#8217;s not answered below, please [email Emmeline](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk), the Event Manager, or tweet [@uxbri](http://twitter.com/uxbri "").**

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

There is no parking available at the venue.

Parking in Brighton is expensive and often hard to come by so we&#8217;d suggest using public transport - the train station is a short walk from the venue and there are several buses which stop nearby. Taxis are also plentiful and reasonably priced.

## Is my registration/ticket transferrable?

Yes, you are welcome to give your ticket to someone else if you can&#8217;t make it.

## Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?

It&#8217;s not really necessary, registration is done by name. However, if you are using someone else&#8217;s ticket, it might be helpful to bring it along.

## What is the refund policy?

Sorry, we are unable to offer refunds.

## The name on the registration/ticket doesn&#8217;t match the attendee. Is that okay?

Yes, that&#8217;s fine! Your name badge will have the original buyers name though.

## My company can&#8217;t pay by card, can you invoice us?

Yes, please email [Emmeline](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk), the Event Manager for further details. Please note that payment is required prior to the event.

## Are you VAT registered?

Yes, UX Brighton (Danny Hope Ltd) is VAT registered. Our number is: 151021667

## I&#8217;m a student, are there discounts available?

Yes, please email [Emmeline](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk), the Event Manager for further details.

## Can I take photographs during the conference?

Usually we say yes of course! *However due to the nature of his work, photographing or filming **Martin Langham** is not permitted; but that&#8217;s our only restriction.* We also encourage tweeting #uxbri. There will be an official photographer and talks will be filmed so you can relive the experience after the event. You can also follow live tweeting at [@uxbri](http://twitter.com/uxbri) on the day.

## Is there anything happening after the conference?

There&#8217;ll be an after party directly after the conference where you can have a free drink and continue the conversation with speakers and other delegates.
