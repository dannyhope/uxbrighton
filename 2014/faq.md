# Frequently Asked Questions

If you have a question that’s not answered below, please [email Emmeline](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk), the Event Manager, or tweet [@uxbri](http://twitter.com/uxbri "").

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

There is no parking available at the venue.

Parking in Brighton is expensive and often hard to come by so we'd suggest using public transport - the train station is a short walk from the venue and there are several buses which stop nearby. Taxis are also plentiful and reasonably priced.

## Is my registration/ticket transferrable?

Yes, you are welcome to give your ticket to someone else if you can't make it.
## Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?

It's not really necessary, registration is done by name. However, if you are using someone elses ticket, it might be helpful to bring it along.

## What is the refund policy?
Sorry, we are unable to offer refunds.

## The name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?

Yes, that's fine! Your name badge will have the original buyers name though.

## My company can't pay by card, can you invoice us?

Yes, please contact [Emmeline](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk), the Event Manager for further details. Please note that payment is required prior to the event.

## Are you VAT registered?

Yes, UX Brighton (Danny Hope Ltd) is VAT registered. Our number is: 151021667

## I'm a student, are there discounts available?

Yes, please contact [Emmeline](mailto:emmeline@uxbrighton.org.uk), the Event Manager for further details.

## Can I take photographs during the conference?

Usually we say yes of course! *However due to the nature of his work, photographing or filming Martin Langham is not permitted; but that's our only restriction.* We also encourage tweeting #uxbri. There will be an official photographer and talks will be filmed so you can relive the experience after the event. You can also follow live tweeting at [@uxbri](http://twitter.com/uxbri) on the day.

## Is there anything happening after the conference?

There'll be an after party directly after the conference where you can have a free drink and continue the conversation with speakers and other delegates.
