Danny Hope

Freelance interaction designer

Founder UX Brighton

curator of ux brighton 2014 - **our 5th conference!**

stand (and stay standing) if you were here last year

**@uxbri**

@yandle

pictures - we’d love to see loads of pictures - snap away

theres 1 talk later on where pictures arent allowed but I’ll remind you at the time

**why philosophy?**

Learning about philosophy improves many aspects of your work as a designer

- the design ideas themselves - metaphors and assumptions in the ideas
- disecting those in teams
- and testing them with users

thinking about things makes us better at making things

# Marianne Talbot

One of the things that got me into philosophy was listening to philosophy podcasts

Possibly the 1st for me was Marianne Talbot’s excellent "Romp through the History of Philosophy" way back in 2008.

--roughly 1,000,000 downloads

--went on to monopolise the entire iTunesU top 10

--As philosophy forms an important foundation for design, Marianne’s talk, I think, will form a foundation for today.

So *I’m very excited to welcome* **Marianne Talbot**

back by noon

## Sjors

In conversations with our speakers and while doing my own research for this years event,

I kept coming across a concept, I’d not heard of but is very useful for thinking about the conditions of uncertainty in which we sometimes operate.

So, hands up who’s familiar with the term hermenutics?

Right? Me neither!

So when Sjors informed me, a few days ago, that he had experienced the same thing and was going to change his talk to focus on Hermenutics, I was a very happy man!

Please *give him a warm welcome*; **Sjors Timmer**

## Ben

There was a dark time, before concepts like evidence and science were prevailant.

The philosopher David Hume was key to changing this.

Our next speaker is here to tell us about David Hume and to explain how we can use his ideas.

Please *welcome to the stage*; **Ben Sauer**

## David Helman

Many of the ideas that have guided my work in recent years have come from philosophers

and many have come from the world of computer science.

--Written about philosophy

--Ph.D. in Philosophy from Harvard

great pleasure that I welcome,

all the way from Oregon USA

philosophy writer and computer scientist

**David Helman**

## Martin Langham

please no photos

hear his talk; see why

while user testing is definitely fun, it’s not the most exciting activity

its not like you are goign to break your arm

or need to wear riot gear

*unless you work for our next speaker* **Martin Langham**

--I’ve met folks from a fair few of agencies but Martin’s company "User Perspective" is doing the most insanely interesting work of any I know.

--Having never had a test participant break their arm

--and not having to own a full set of riot gear

## Afternoon break-break-break-breakbreak-

## Anna Cox

--speakers touched on the need to balance sceince. With these last 2 talks, we’ll try and expand on this matter.

I’m a scientist at heart so I often find myself trying to explain to others what good science is.

So I’ve asked Anna Cox along to show me how it’s done.

Anna is Deputy Director of the UCL Interaction Centre and a Reader in HCI

*Please give her a warm round of applause,* **Anna Cox**

## Andy Clarke

I’m an artist at heart so…

When I heard our next speaker discuss the creative genius of 60s ad agencies, and fight the corner for what we might call a less scientific approach to design. I thought he would be the perfect person to round off the day.

*Please welcome, one of web design’s most well respected designers,* **Andy Clarke**
